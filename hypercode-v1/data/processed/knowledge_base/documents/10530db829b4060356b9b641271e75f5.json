  "content": "# 🚀 Windsurf Advanced Tricks & Hacks for HyperCode\n\nReal-world tips, gotchas, and pro moves from veteran Windsurf users. These will unlock 10x more power from Cascade.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 SECTION 1: Advanced Cascade Tactics\n\n### Hack #1: \"Prime Before Execute\"\n\n**The Problem:** You ask Cascade to build a feature, but it jumps straight to coding without thinking. Result = messy, broke code.\n\n**The Hack:**\n```\nBefore I ask you to code, let's think step-by-step.\n\nStep 1: Summarize the HyperCode architecture as it stands today.\nStep 2: List the files you'll need to touch.\nStep 3: Explain the change in 1-2 sentences.\nStep 4: Show me the plan—don't implement yet.\n\nOnly after I approve the plan, then build it.\n```\n\n**Why it works:** AI models are WAY better when you make them think before acting. You get fewer hallucinations, fewer false starts, and way cleaner code. [web:24]\n\n---\n\n### Hack #2: \"Context Dump File\"\n\n**The Hack:** Create a `.windsurf/context.md` in your repo with this structure:\n\n```markdown\n# HyperCode Current State\n\n## Architecture\n- Parser: `src/lexer.ts` + `src/parser.ts`\n- AST: `src/ast.ts`\n- Codegen: `src/codegen.ts`\n- Tests: `tests/` (run with `npm test`)\n\n## Known Issues\n- Parser sometimes hangs on deeply nested expressions\n- Lexer doesn't handle Unicode escapes yet\n- Missing error messages for type mismatches\n\n## Recent Changes\n- [Nov 28] Added spatial logic support to AST\n- [Nov 27] Fixed tokenizer for multiline comments\n\n## Next Priorities\n1. Performance optimization for large files\n2. Better error messages\n3. Integration with AI models\n\n## Coding Rules\n- Tests MUST pass before any merge\n- No magic numbers\n- Always update CHANGELOG.md\n```\n\nThen prompt Cascade with:\n```\nRead .windsurf/context.md to understand the full state of HyperCode.\nNow, [YOUR TASK HERE].\n```\n\n**Why it works:** Cascade won't have to re-ask you about architecture every time. It's like giving it a cheat sheet. [web:31]\n\n---\n\n### Hack #3: \"Break Tests into Categories\"\n\n**The Hack:** Organize your tests so Cascade can run targeted checks:\n\n```bash\n# tests/unit/lexer.test.ts — Fast, runs in <1s\n# tests/unit/parser.test.ts — Fast\n# tests/integration/endtoend.test.ts — Slower, runs in ~5s\n\n# package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test:unit\": \"jest tests/unit\",\n    \"test:integration\": \"jest tests/integration\",\n    \"test:fast\": \"jest tests/unit\",  # Use when you want quick feedback\n    \"test\": \"jest\"  # Full suite\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen tell Cascade:\n```\nRun `npm run test:fast` first. If that passes, run `npm run test:integration`.\nOnly move forward if both pass.\n```\n\n**Why it works:** Cascade can iterate faster if it knows which tests are \"canaries\" and which are \"heavy.\" Saves minutes per fix cycle. [web:28]\n\n---\n\n### Hack #4: \"Staged Diffs\"\n\n**The Hack:** Ask Cascade to show you the diff BEFORE applying it:\n\n```\nYou are fixing a bug in the parser.\n\nStep 1: Identify the bug.\nStep 2: Propose a fix (show me the code diff, don't apply yet).\nStep 3: Wait for my approval.\nStep 4: Only then apply the fix.\nStep 5: Re-run tests.\n```\n\n**Why it works:** Stops Cascade from making wild changes you can't review. You stay in control. [web:28]\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 SECTION 2: Workflows (The Hidden Power)\n\nWorkflows are like \"slash commands\" for Cascade. Game changer.\n\n### Hack #5: \"Saved Workflows\"\n\nCreate `.windsurf/workflows/fix-and-test.md`:\n\n```markdown\n# /fix-and-test\n\n## Description\nRun the full self-fix cycle: find broken tests, fix them, lint, and verify.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Run tests to find failures:\n   Execute: `npm test`\n   Wait for output and capture errors.\n\n2. Analyze failures:\n   For each failing test:\n   - Read the test file\n   - Read the implementation file\n   - Identify the root cause (1 sentence)\n\n3. Fix ONE test at a time:\n   - Make minimal change (<10 lines)\n   - Re-run: `npm test`\n   - If pass: move to next test\n   - If fail: debug and iterate\n\n4. After all tests pass:\n   - Run: `npm run lint`\n   - Fix any linting issues (if safe)\n\n5. Final verification:\n   - Run: `npm test` (full)\n   - Run: `npm run build`\n   - If both pass: done!\n\n6. Update CHANGELOG.md:\n   \"Fixed: [list of issues fixed]\"\n```\n\nThen in Cascade, just type `/fix-and-test` and hit enter. Cascade runs the whole workflow automatically. [web:30]\n\n**Pro tip:** You can chain workflows:\n```markdown\n# /full-ci\n\n## Steps\n1. Run `/fix-and-test`\n2. Run `/lint-and-format`\n3. Run `/update-docs`\n```\n\n---\n\n### Hack #6: \"Multi-Cascade Parallel Work\"\n\nWindsurf now lets you run **multiple Cascades at the same time**. [web:27]\n\n**Example:**\n- Cascade #1: Fixing parser bugs (in `src/parser.ts`)\n- Cascade #2: Adding lexer features (in `src/lexer.ts`)\n\nBoth run in parallel, save time.\n\n**How to use:**\n1. Open Cascade\n2. Start your first task\n3. Open a **second Cascade** (new tab or panel)\n4. Start a different task\n5. Watch both run side-by-side\n\n**Constraint:** Make sure they don't touch the same files, or merges get messy.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 SECTION 3: Rules Hacks\n\n### Hack #7: \"File-Scoped Rules\"\n\nCreate `.windsurf/rules/parser-rules.md`:\n\n```markdown\n# Parser-Specific Rules\n\nThese rules apply ONLY to files in `src/parser.ts` and `src/lexer.ts`.\n\n## Rules\n- Keep parser functions < 80 lines\n- Every token type must have a test\n- Use named constants for token IDs (not magic numbers)\n- Document any lookahead logic with a comment\n- Parser errors must include line/column info\n```\n\nThen create `.windsurf/rules/codegen-rules.md`:\n\n```markdown\n# Codegen-Specific Rules\n\nThese apply ONLY to `src/codegen.ts`.\n\n## Rules\n- All generated code must be valid and runnable\n- Add source maps for debugging\n- Test code generation with at least 3 example HyperCode programs\n```\n\nWindsurf applies these automatically to the right files. [web:27]\n\n---\n\n### Hack #8: \"Living Rules from Tests\"\n\nPut this in `.windsurfrules`:\n\n```yaml\n# Extract rules from failing tests\n\nrule_extraction:\n  - \"If a test fails, read the test name to understand what was expected\"\n  - \"If the test is called test_parseExpression_withNestedCalls, the parser must handle nested calls\"\n  - \"If test fails, it's describing a bug—fix the code, not the test\"\n```\n\nThis makes Cascade treat tests as \"ground truth\" for behavior.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 SECTION 4: Terminal & Commands Hacks\n\n### Hack #9: \"Smart Test Selection\"\n\n**The Hack:** Create `scripts/run-tests.sh`:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Smart test runner: runs only affected tests based on git diff\n\nCHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1)\n\nif echo \"$CHANGED_FILES\" | grep -q \"src/lexer\"; then\n  echo \"Lexer changed, running lexer tests...\"\n  npm run test:unit -- lexer.test.ts\nfi\n\nif echo \"$CHANGED_FILES\" | grep -q \"src/parser\"; then\n  echo \"Parser changed, running parser tests...\"\n  npm run test:unit -- parser.test.ts\nfi\n\nif echo \"$CHANGED_FILES\" | grep -q \"src/codegen\"; then\n  echo \"Codegen changed, running codegen tests...\"\n  npm run test:unit -- codegen.test.ts\nfi\n\n# Always run integration tests\nnpm run test:integration\n```\n\nTell Cascade:\n```\nUse `bash scripts/run-tests.sh` to run only the tests affected by your changes.\nThis saves time.\n```\n\n**Why:** Cascade can iterate in 1/10 the time if it doesn't run the full suite every time. [web:28]\n\n---\n\n### Hack #10: \"Diff Review Before Commit\"\n\n**The Hack:** Create `.husky/pre-commit` to auto-review Cascade changes:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Before committing, show Cascade-made diffs for review\n\nSTAGED=$(git diff --cached)\n\nif [ -z \"$STAGED\" ]; then\n  echo \"Nothing to commit.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\necho \"==========================================\"\necho \"REVIEW THESE CHANGES BEFORE COMMITTING\"\necho \"==========================================\"\necho \"$STAGED\"\necho \"==========================================\"\necho \"Press Enter to continue, or Ctrl+C to abort.\"\nread -r\n\ngit commit -m \"[Windsurf Auto-Fix]\"\n```\n\n**Why:** Stops accidental commits of broken code. You always see what Cascade changed.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 SECTION 5: Memory & Context Hacks\n\n### Hack #11: \"Persistent Memory Bank\"\n\nCreate a **Memory** in Windsurf (via Customizations > Memories) with this:\n\n```\n# HyperCode Core Concepts\n\n## Spatial Logic\nHyperCode uses spatial positioning instead of indentation:\n- `left_of`, `above`, `below`, `inside` are first-class operators\n- Example: `parser` left_of `lexer` means the parser depends on lexer output\n\n## Neurodivergent First\n- Clarity > brevity (spell things out)\n- Examples > theorizing (show, don't tell)\n- Tests > documentation (tests are the truth)\n- Accessibility: consider ADHD/dyslexia/autism brain patterns\n\n## AI Compatibility\n- Code must work with GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, and Ollama\n- No vendor lock-in\n- Self-explanatory variable names (no abbreviations)\n\n## Architecture\n- Parser produces AST\n- AST is validated\n- Codegen outputs JavaScript/Python/Go\n- All features tested end-to-end\n```\n\nThen reference it in prompts:\n```\nRecall the HyperCode Core Concepts from Memory.\nNow build [FEATURE] following those principles.\n```\n\n**Why:** Windsurf remembers context between sessions. You don't have to re-explain HyperCode every time. [web:31]\n\n---\n\n### Hack #12: \"Error Pattern Memory\"\n\nCreate a Memory called \"Known Bugs & Fixes\":\n\n```\n# Known HyperCode Bugs & Quick Fixes\n\n## Bug: Parser hangs on deeply nested expressions\n- Root cause: Recursion limit not checked\n- Fix: Add MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH check in parseExpression()\n- File: src/parser.ts, line ~142\n- Tests: tests/unit/parser.test.ts::test_parseExpression_withDeepNesting\n\n## Bug: Lexer skips whitespace in multiline strings\n- Root cause: Whitespace trimming happens before multiline check\n- Fix: Move multiline check BEFORE trimming\n- File: src/lexer.ts, line ~87\n- Quick test: npm run test:unit -- lexer.test.ts\n\n## Pattern: Type mismatches in codegen\n- Usually means AST node structure changed but codegen wasn't updated\n- Check: Are new AST fields being generated?\n- Fix: Cascade should output TypeScript for type safety\n```\n\nWhen Cascade encounters an error, it checks this Memory and knows the fix.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 SECTION 6: Prompt Engineering Tricks\n\n### Hack #13: \"The \"Explain Your Work\" Prompt**\n\nUse this when Cascade makes a fix you don't understand:\n\n```\nYou just changed [FILE] on lines [X-Y].\n\nNow explain:\n1. What was broken?\n2. Why did it break?\n3. How does your fix solve it?\n4. Why didn't you try [OTHER APPROACH]?\n5. Are there any side effects?\n```\n\nCascade will articulate its reasoning, which helps you learn and catch mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### Hack #14: \"The Constraint-Based Prompt\"\n\nUse this to prevent Cascade from going rogue:\n\n```\nYou are fixing the parser.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS:\n- NEVER touch lexer.ts, codegen.ts, or any test files\n- NEVER change the parseExpression signature\n- NEVER add new dependencies\n- NEVER remove any existing tests\n\nSOFT CONSTRAINTS:\n- Prefer minimal changes\n- Keep functions < 100 lines\n- Add comments if logic is non-obvious\n\nNow: [YOUR TASK]\n```\n\n**Why:** Constraints keep Cascade in its lane. Way fewer \"oops\" moments. [web:28]\n\n---\n\n### Hack #15: \"The Approval Loop\"\n\nUse this for high-stakes changes:\n\n```\nYou are implementing a major refactor.\n\nStep 1: Show me the plan (files to change, steps involved).\nStep 2: WAIT for my approval.\nStep 3: After approval, implement step-by-step.\nStep 4: After each step, show me the diff.\nStep 5: WAIT for my approval again.\nStep 6: Move to next step.\n\nOnly move forward when I say \"approved\" or \"looks good\".\n```\n\nThis turns Cascade into a collaborative partner, not a runaway agent.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 SECTION 7: Testing Hacks\n\n### Hack #16: \"Test-First Prompting\"\n\nBefore implementing, ask Cascade to write tests:\n\n```\nWrite tests for [FEATURE] following these rules:\n- Test names describe what should happen: test_featureName_withInput_expectsOutput\n- Cover edge cases: null, empty, overflow, etc.\n- Use assertions, not just print statements\n- Make tests runnable immediately (even if they fail)\n\nAfter writing tests, tell me if any look incomplete or missing edge cases.\nONLY THEN will I ask you to implement the feature.\n```\n\nTests become your spec. Cascade codes to pass them. [web:28]\n\n---\n\n### Hack #17: \"The Failing Test as Specification\"\n\nWhen a test fails, never ask Cascade to \"fix it.\" Instead:\n\n```\nTest [TEST_NAME] is failing.\n\nDON'T ask me what to do.\nInstead:\n1. Read the test carefully\n2. Read the implementation\n3. Figure out what the test expects\n4. Update the code to match the test's expectation\n5. Re-run the test\n6. If still failing, iterate\n\nThe test is the specification. Make the code pass the test.\n```\n\nThis makes Cascade think like a real developer.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 SECTION 8: Safety & Debugging Hacks\n\n### Hack #18: \"The Rollback Shortcut\"\n\nBefore running Cascade on something risky, create a backup branch:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b backup/before-windsurf-magic\ngit checkout -b feature/windsurf-changes\n```\n\nIf things go south:\n```bash\ngit reset --hard backup/before-windsurf-magic\n```\n\nYou're back to square one in 1 second.\n\n---\n\n### Hack #19: \"Live Diff Watching\"\n\nIn a second terminal, keep watching changes:\n\n```bash\nwatch -n 1 'git diff --stat'\n```\n\nYou'll see files changing in real-time. Useful to catch runaway agents.\n\n---\n\n### Hack #20: \"The Kill Switch\"\n\nIf Cascade is acting weird:\n1. **Press Escape** to stop the current operation\n2. **Close the Cascade panel**\n3. **Restart Cascade**\n4. **Start fresh with a smaller task**\n\nDon't let it compound errors. Better to restart than debug chaos.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 SECTION 9: Workflow Templates (Copy & Paste)\n\n### Template 1: Weekly Code Review Workflow\n\nCreate `.windsurf/workflows/weekly-review.md`:\n\n```markdown\n# /weekly-review\n\n## Steps\n\n1. List all files changed this week:\n   `git log --name-only --since=\"1 week ago\" | sort -u`\n\n2. For each file:\n   - Read the changes\n   - Ask: \"Does this follow HyperCode principles?\"\n   - Ask: \"Is this testable?\"\n   - Ask: \"Is this documented?\"\n\n3. Create a summary:\n   - Highlight good patterns\n   - Flag things that need attention\n   - Suggest improvements\n```\n\n---\n\n### Template 2: Dependency Audit Workflow\n\n```markdown\n# /dependency-audit\n\n## Steps\n\n1. List all dependencies:\n   `npm list --depth=0` or `pip list`\n\n2. For each dependency, ask:\n   - Is it still used?\n   - Is it up-to-date?\n   - Does it have security issues?\n\n3. Update package.json/requirements.txt\n\n4. Run tests to ensure nothing broke\n\n5. Commit with message: \"[Maintenance] Updated dependencies\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 FINAL TIPS\n\n### Pro Move 1: \"Session Starts Fresh\"\nWindsurf context can get bloated. Every few days, start a new Cascade session. Fresh context = better decisions. [web:28]\n\n### Pro Move 2: \"Use Memories for Tribal Knowledge\"\nDocument weird bugs, architecture decisions, and workarounds in Memories. Future-you will thank you.\n\n### Pro Move 3: \"Test Cascade with Small Tasks First\"\nDon't throw a \"build an interpreter\" task at Cascade on day one. Start with \"fix this one test\" and build confidence.\n\n### Pro Move 4: \"Pair Program with Cascade\"\nDon't just hand off to Cascade and walk away. Watch it work. Ask questions. Learn its strengths and weaknesses.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Now You're Unstoppable\n\nYou've got:\n- ✅ Rules to keep Cascade in line\n- ✅ Workflows to automate repetitive tasks\n- ✅ Prompts to guide its thinking\n- ✅ Hacks to save time\n- ✅ Safety nets to catch mistakes\n\nGo build HyperCode with Windsurf as your co-pilot. 💪🚀\n\n**The future of development is: human + AI, not AI alone.**",
