  "content": "# HyperCode Research Module\n\nThis repository contains a lightweight implementation of the\n``research`` module described in previous conversations.  It is\nintended to serve as a foundation for logging and analysing\nexperiments conducted with the HyperCode language.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe key files are under `backend/research`:\n\n- `db.py` – sets up a SQLAlchemy engine and session factory.  The\n  database URL is read from the `RESEARCH_DATABASE_URL` environment\n  variable.  If unset, a local SQLite file `hypercode_research.db`\n  in the project root will be used instead.  This makes it\n  straightforward to run the module without any external\n  dependencies.\n- `models.py` – defines ORM models for Studies, Sources, Language\n  Versions, Tasks, Participants, Sessions, Events and Feedback.  It\n  follows the schema discussed earlier, including flexible JSON\n  payloads for event data and array fields for tags and ND profiles.\n- `scripts/seed_basic_data.py` – a small script to create the\n  database tables and populate them with a starter study and\n  language version.  Run this at least once to verify that your\n  environment is configured correctly.\n- `scripts/import_sources_from_folder.py` – a utility for bulk\n  loading files (PDFs, markdown, HTML) into the `sources` table.\n  The script infers the ``kind`` based on file extension and\n  preserves the original filename in the database.\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. **Install dependencies** (for example in a virtualenv):\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary  # for PostgreSQL support\n   ```\n\n2. **Set up a database**:\n\n   Define the `RESEARCH_DATABASE_URL` environment variable.  For\n   PostgreSQL:\n\n   ```bash\n   export RESEARCH_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/dbname\n   ```\n\n   If the variable is not set then the module will use an in–file\n   SQLite database (`sqlite:///hypercode_research.db`).  This is\n   useful for local experimentation.\n\n3. **Create the tables and seed some data**:\n\n   Run the seed script:\n\n   ```bash\n   python hypercode/backend/research/scripts/seed_basic_data.py\n   ```\n\n   This will create all tables (if they do not already exist) and\n   insert a starter Study and LanguageVersion.  You can inspect\n   these by opening the database with your favourite SQL tool.\n\n4. **Import your sources**:\n\n   Put some PDFs or markdown files into a folder (for example\n   `data/research_sources`) and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python hypercode/backend/research/scripts/import_sources_from_folder.py data/research_sources\n   ```\n\n   Each file will be registered as a ``Source`` in the database.\n\n5. **Integrate into your application**:\n\n   Import the models and session factory from `hypercode.backend.research`\n   to create new studies, sessions, events and feedback records from\n   your HyperCode playground or other services.  See the docstrings\n   in `models.py` for more details.\n\n## Next steps\n\nThis module can be extended in several directions:\n\n- Integrate [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) by\n  adding embedding columns to the `sources` and `feedback` tables\n  (see commented lines in `models.py`).  Use a background job to\n  compute embeddings.\n- Wrap the ORM with a small API (for example with FastAPI) to\n  decouple research logging from the core HyperCode runtime.\n- Add more sophisticated data importers (for example to parse\n  transcripts or logs) and exporters (for example to produce reports\n  or dashboards).\n\nFeel free to adapt and evolve this structure to suit the needs of\nyour research.  The goal is to capture structured data about\nHyperCode experiments in a way that supports rigorous analysis and\ncontinuous improvement.",
