The arbitrary syntax, context switching penalties, high cognitive \nload... it was exhausting.\n\nSo I built HyperCode—a language that respects how ADHD brains actually work:\n\n- Less mental overhead\n- Pattern-based thinking support\n- Visual spatial layout option\n- Works better with hyperfocus sessions\n\nNot just ADHD—designed for autism, dyslexia, and everyone who thinks differently.\n\n**Try it:** https://welshdog.github.io/hypercode/web-playground/\n\nWould love feedback from the community!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Twitter Thread (8 Tweets)\n\n**Tweet 1:**\n```\nI spent 6 months building a programming language \nfor neurodivergent brains. Not because I wanted to,\nbut because I had to. Traditional languages hurt.\n\nHyperCode is the solution I wish existed. 🧵👇\n```\n\n**Tweet 2:**\n```\nThe problem: Traditional programming has 3 attacks \non neurodivergent brains:\n1. High cognitive load (arbitrary syntax)\n2. Context-switching penalties\n3. Zero accessibility\n\nWhy would anyone use that?\n```\n\n**Tweet 3:**\n```\nHyperCode is different:\n- 2D spatial code layout (matches pattern thinking)\n- 40% fewer tokens vs Python\n- WCAG AAA accessible\n- Works with any AI (Claude, GPT, Mistral)\n\nIt's not just different. It's better.\n```\n\n**Tweet 4:**\n```\nFeaturing forgotten programming paradigms:\n- Befunge (2D spatial thinking)\n- Plankalkül (forgotten genius)\n- Modern AI optimization\n\nWe're resurrecting the past to build the future.\n```\n\n**Tweet 5:**\n```\nTry it RIGHT NOW (30 seconds):\nhttps://welshdog.github.io/hypercode/web-playground/\n\nOr dive deep:\nhttps://github.com/welshDog/hypercode\nhttps://github.com/welshDog/hypercode-research\n```\n\n**Tweet 6:**\n```\nLooking for:\n- Early adopters (try it, give feedback)\n- Contributors (Python/JS/Rust)\n- Researchers (neurodivergent design)\n- Advocates (tell your friends)\n\nReply if interested 👇\n```\n\n**Tweet 7:**\n```\nThis isn't just a language. It's a movement.\n\nProving software can be designed FOR humans,\nnot AGAINST them.\n\nProving neurodivergent brains aren't the problem—\nthe tools are.\n\nLet's fix that.\n```\n\n**Tweet 8:**\n```\nOpen source. Community-driven. Radically accessible.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/welshDog/hypercode\nPlayground: https://welshdog.github.io/hypercode/web-playground/\nResearch: https://github.com/welshDog/hypercode-research\n\nJoin us. 🧠💻\n```\n\n---\n\n## Expected Results\n\n| Metric | Target |\n|--------|--------|\n| GitHub Stars | 50-200 |\n| Reddit Upvotes | 200+ combined |\n| Twitter Impressions | 500+ |\n| New Contributors | 2-3 |\n| Discord/Discussion Members | 5+ |\n\n---\n\n## Next: TIER 2 (Weeks 2-3)\n- Record quickstart video\n- Post to r/neurodiversity\n- Set up Discord\n- Update main repo README\n\n*See: RESEARCH-INTEGRATION.md, ROADMAP.md*",
