  "content": "# 🤝 Contributing to HyperCode\n\nFirst off, **thank you** for considering contributing to HyperCode! 💓 Whether you're\nfixing a typo, proposing a feature, or building an entire module, you're helping reshape\nhow minds interact with code.\n\n**This is a judgment-free, inclusive space.** We welcome contributions from all\nbackgrounds, skill levels, and neurotypes. No gatekeeping. Period.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Code of Conduct\n\nWe are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all\ncontributors. We expect all community members to:\n\n- **Be respectful** of different perspectives, experiences, and identities\n- **Be patient** with beginners and those learning\n- **Be constructive** in feedback and discussion\n- **Report harm** privately to maintainers without public shaming\n- **Celebrate differences** — neurodivergence, backgrounds, cultures, abilities\n\n**Zero tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or exclusion.** If you experience or\nwitness this, report it immediately.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Node.js 16+ and npm 8+\n- Git\n- A GitHub account\n- A text editor or IDE of your choice\n\n### Setting Up Your Development Environment\n\n```bash\n# 1.
