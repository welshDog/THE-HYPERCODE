start within neurodivergent circles |\n| Technical debt | High | Enforce code review, automated testing, documentation from day 1 |\n| Burnout (small team) | High | Set realistic goals; delegate ruthlessly; take breaks |\n| Competing projects | Medium | Differentiate: neurodivergent-first + AI compatibility (unique combo) |\n| Quantum/DNA modules too complex | Medium | MVP without them; add in Phase 2 |\n\n---\n\n## **Post-90-Day Vision (Months 4–12)**\n\n- **Month 4**: v0.5 (Rust compiler)\n- **Month 5–6**: DNA computing module, published paper\n- **Month 7**: IDE plugins (VS Code, JetBrains)\n- **Month 8**: Package manager alpha\n- **Month 9**: 5,000+ stars, first commercial interest\n- **Month 10–12**: Multi-language implementations (Go, C++), enterprise pilots\n\n---\n\n## **The Bigger Picture**\n\nIn 90 days, you're not just shipping a language. You're **launching a movement** that says:\n\n> **\"Programming languages should be designed for *all* minds, not just the ones that fit a C-based mold.\"**\n\nBy Day 90, HyperCode will have proven:\n1. **Viable**: Working interpreter, real code runs\n2. **Unique**: Neurodivergent-first design differentiates it\n3. **Credible**: Academic paper + industry partnerships\n4. **Community-Driven**: 500+ members, open RFC process\n5. **Future-Ready**: Quantum + DNA + AI ready\n\n---\n\n## **Final Thought**\n\nThis is an audacious roadmap. But audacious is the point.\n\nProgramming hasn't changed fundamentally since C (1972). Meanwhile, our understanding of neurodiversity, quantum computing, and AI has exploded. HyperCode is the synthesis of that explosion.\n\n**In 90 days, the conversation shifts. People will ask: \"Why *don't* we have a neurodivergent-first language?\"**\n\nYou're about to answer that question with working code.\n\n🚀 Let's go.",
