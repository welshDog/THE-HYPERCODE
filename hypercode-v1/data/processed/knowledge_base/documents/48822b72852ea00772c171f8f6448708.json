The language prioritizes spatial logic over dense text, minimal cognitive noise, and visual clarity. Key principles include: (1) Spatial Programming Blocks—code organized in visual spatial containers, not just linear text; (2) Minimal Syntax Noise—no excessive brackets, semicolons, or decorative symbols; (3) Natural Language Integration—write code that reads almost like prose; (4) Accessibility-First—built-in dyslexia-friendly fonts, high contrast modes, and screen reader support; (5) ADHD-Friendly Defaults—clear visual hierarchy, progressive disclosure of complexity, built-in focus management.\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.perplexity.ai/spaces/hypercode-core\",\n      \"tags\": [\"neurodivergent\", \"accessibility\", \"design-philosophy\", \"core-concepts\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Multi-Syntax Mode Architecture\",\n      \"content\": \"HyperCode supports three primary syntax modes to accommodate different coding preferences and neurodivergent cognitive styles: (1) Spatial Mode—block-based visual programming where code is organized in containers; (2) Natural Language Mode—write code in conversational English that compiles directly; (3) Minimal Mode—ultra-clean syntax for distraction-sensitive developers. Each mode compiles to the same intermediate representation (IR), allowing seamless switching. The transpiler detects which mode is being used and applies appropriate parsing rules.
