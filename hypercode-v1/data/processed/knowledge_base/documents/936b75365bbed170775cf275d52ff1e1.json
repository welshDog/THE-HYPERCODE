Scroll down to \"Features\" section\n3. Check the \"Discussions\" checkbox\n4. Click \"Save changes\"\n\n## Step 2: Create First Discussion\n\nOnce enabled, create a new discussion with:\n\n**Title:** Community Brainstorm: What should HyperCode's first superpower be?\n\n**Body:**\n\n```\n# 🚀 Community Brainstorm: HyperCode's First Superpower\n\nHey everyone! We've been building HyperCode to make programming more accessible for neurodivergent developers. Now we need YOUR help deciding what feature to prioritize next.\n\n## 🎯 The Challenge\nWe can only focus on ONE major feature right now. What would be most valuable for YOU?\n\n## 🤔 Option A: Instant Visual Debugging 🐛\n- See your code execute step-by-step with visual highlights\n- Perfect for ADHD minds that need to see the flow\n- Like having a pair programmer that shows you exactly what's happening\n\n## 🤔 Option B: Smart Code Completion with Context 🧠\n- AI-powered suggestions that understand your intent\n- Learns your coding style and patterns\n- Reduces cognitive load by predicting what you need next\n\n## 🤔 Option C: Real-Time Collaboration Mode 👥\n- Code together in real-time like Google Docs\n- Built for pair programming and study groups\n- Visual indicators show who's changing what\n\n## 🤔 Option D: One-Click Deployment 🚀\n- Turn your HyperCode into a live web app instantly\n- No setup, no configuration, just click and share\n- Great for showing off your work without the headache\n\n## 📊 Vote Below!\nComment with:\n- **A** for Visual Debugging\n- **B** for Smart Completion\n- **C** for Real-Time Collaboration\n- **D** for One-Click Deployment\n\n**Bonus:** Tell us WHY you chose that option and how it would help YOUR coding journey!\n\n## 🔥 What Happens Next?\n- We'll build the winning feature first\n- You'll get early access to test it\n- Your feedback will shape the final implementation\n\nLet's build something amazing together! 🌟\n```\n\n## Step 3: Pin the Discussion\n\nAfter creating, pin it to the top of the Discussions tab.\n\n## Step 4: Share the Discussion\n\nPost links to this discussion on:\n\n- Reddit r/neurodivergent\n- Twitter\n- dev.to\n- Any relevant communities\n\nThis creates immediate engagement and feedback!",
