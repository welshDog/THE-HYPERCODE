If you discover a security vulnerability,\nplease report it responsibly.\n\n### **How to Report**\n\n**Please do NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.\n\nInstead, please send your report to:\n\n- **Email**: security@hypercode.dev\n- **Discord**: Direct message to @welshDog (Lyndz Williams)\n\n### **What to Include**\n\nPlease include as much information as possible:\n\n- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, authentication bypass)\n- **Steps to reproduce** the issue\n- **Affected versions** of HyperCode\n- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability\n- **Proof of concept** or exploit code (if available)\n\n### **Response Timeline**\n\n- **Within 48 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of your report\n- **Within 7 days**: Detailed assessment and timeline for fix\n- **Within 30 days**: Patch released (for critical vulnerabilities)\n\n### **Security Best Practices**\n\n#### For Users\n\n- Keep your HyperCode installation updated\n- Use API keys securely (don't commit them to repositories)\n- Review permissions for AI model integrations\n- Enable security scanning in your CI/CD pipelines\n\n#### For Contributors\n\n- Follow secure coding practices\n- Use environment variables for sensitive data\n- Review code for security implications\n- Add security tests for new features\n\n#### For API Integrations\n\n- Store API keys in environment variables, not code\n- Use HTTPS for all API communications\n- Implement proper error handling for API failures\n- Rate limit API calls to prevent abuse\n\n### **Current Security Features**\n\n✅ **Implemented**\n\n- Environment variable management for API keys\n- Input validation for user inputs\n- Secure HTTP communications\n- Code scanning in CI/CD pipeline\n\n🔄 **In Progress**\n\n- Dependency vulnerability scanning\n- Automated security testing\n- Security audit logging\n\n⚠️ **Planned**\n\n- Two-factor authentication for admin functions\n- API key rotation mechanisms\n- Advanced threat detection\n\n### **Known Security Considerations**\n\n#### API Keys\n\n- API keys are stored in `.env` files (should not be committed)\n- No built-in API key rotation (planned feature)\n- API keys are transmitted over HTTPS\n\n#### AI Model Integration\n\n- Third-party AI services have their own security policies\n- Code sent to AI services may be logged by providers\n- Review AI provider privacy policies before use\n\n#### Dependencies\n\n- Regular dependency updates required\n- Some dependencies may have security implications\n- Monitor CVE databases for vulnerabilities\n\n### **Security Updates**\n\nSecurity updates will be:\n\n- Announced in release notes\n- Posted on Discord announcements\n- Tagged with security labels in GitHub issues\n\n### **Security Team**\n\n- **Lead**: Lyndz Williams (@welshDog)\n- **Contact**: security@hypercode.dev\n- **Response**: 48-hour initial response guarantee\n\n### **Acknowledgments**\n\nWe thank security researchers who help us keep HyperCode secure. All valid security\nreports will be acknowledged in our security hall of fame.\n\n---\n\n**Last Updated**: November 16, 2025 **Version**: 1.0 **Next Review**: January 2026\n\nFor general security questions or concerns, please join our\n[Discord community](https://discord.gg/hypercode) and ask in the #security channel.",
