  "content": "# HyperCode Cascade Prompts: Ready-to-Paste AI Automation 🤖\n\nThese are **battle-tested prompts** you copy directly into Windsurf's Cascade Write/Agent mode.\nEach one sets up a different \"self-healing\" workflow. Pick the one that fits your need.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 PROMPT 1: \"Full Self-Fix Mode\" (The Main One)\n\n**Use this when tests are failing and you want Windsurf to debug + fix + verify automatically.**\n\nPaste this into Cascade Write mode:\n\n```\nYou are HyperCode's autonomous maintenance agent.\n\nYour mission: Read the repo, identify failing tests or build errors, then iteratively fix them.\n\nProtocol:\n1. Run the test/build command (npm test / pytest / cargo test)\n2. Capture the FULL error output\n3. Read the source file(s) causing the failure\n4. Propose a minimal fix (surgical edits only, <20 lines changed per cycle)\n5. Apply the fix\n6. Re-run tests\n7. If tests pass: update CHANGELOG.md with what you fixed\n8. If tests fail: analyze why and iterate (don't give up)\n\nConstraints:\n- NEVER modify protected directories (.git, .github, node_modules, venv, .windsurf)\n- NEVER commit or push; only show diffs for approval\n- NEVER add dependencies without asking first\n- Keep each change reversible\n- Respect the .windsurfrules file\n\nGo. Show your work as you go.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 PROMPT 2: \"Build New Feature + Self-Fix While Building\"\n\n**Use this when you want Windsurf to implement a new feature AND keep tests green the whole time.**\n\n```\nYou are building a new HyperCode feature.\n\nStep 1: Create a plan.md file that lists every step to implement [FEATURE NAME].\n  - Be detailed: what files get created/modified, what tests get added, what's the success criteria.\n  - Format: numbered checklist with brief descriptions.\n\nStep 2: Follow your plan step by step.\n  - After each checklist item:\n    - Update plan.md to mark it done\n    - Run the full test suite (npm test / pytest / cargo test)\n    - If tests fail: stop, debug, fix, then continue\n    - Only move to the next item when tests are green\n\nStep 3: When done:\n  - Verify ALL tests pass\n  - Verify NO new linting warnings (npm run lint / pylint)\n  - Update README.md with the new feature\n  - Summarize what was added in CHANGELOG.md\n\nConstraints:\n- Write tests ALONGSIDE code, not after\n- Keep functions < 100 lines\n- Use descriptive names (no abbreviations)\n- Follow HyperCode neurodivergent-first philosophy: clarity > cleverness\n- Ask before adding new dependencies\n\nStart by creating the plan.md file.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 PROMPT 3: \"Refactor + Self-Fix\" (For Code Cleanup)\n\n**Use this when you want to modernize or reorganize code without breaking functionality.**\n\n```\nYou are refactoring HyperCode code for clarity and maintainability.\n\nObjective: [DESCRIBE THE REFACTOR: e.g., \"Move all parser logic into separate module\", \"Simplify the AST node structure\", etc.]\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Read the current code structure\n2. Design a plan for the refactor (show it to me first)\n3. Create new files/modules as needed\n4. Move and adapt code gradually (not all at once)\n5. After each major change: run tests (npm test / pytest / cargo test)\n6. Keep old tests passing; don't break public APIs\n7. Update imports and documentation\n8. Once complete: update CHANGELOG.md\n\nGuardrails:\n- NEVER delete code without tests confirming it's unused\n- NEVER change public function signatures without updating all call sites\n- Keep backward compatibility unless explicitly breaking (then document it)\n- Test coverage should stay >= 80%\n\nStart by showing me the refactor plan. I'll approve before you make changes.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 PROMPT 4: \"Surgical Inline Fix\" (For Tiny Bugs)\n\n**Use this for ONE broken function or section—keep changes super focused.**\n\n```\nYou are making a surgical fix to a specific bug.\n\nContext:\n- File: [PATH/TO/FILE]\n- Problem: [DESCRIBE THE BUG: e.g., \"Parser hangs on recursive input\", \"Lexer skips whitespace incorrectly\"]\n- Expected behavior: [WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN]\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Read the buggy function carefully\n2. Identify the root cause (1-2 lines usually)\n3. Propose a fix (minimal, <5 lines changed if possible)\n4. Apply it\n5. Run tests to verify the bug is fixed and nothing else broke\n6. Update CHANGELOG.md with the fix\n\nConstraints:\n- ONLY modify the buggy function, not surrounding code\n- Don't refactor while fixing (separate concerns)\n- Add a test case that catches this bug if it doesn't exist\n- Keep the public interface unchanged\n\nGo. Show me the diff before you commit anything.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 PROMPT 5: \"Linting + Format Fix\" (Keep Code Clean)\n\n**Use this when you want to auto-fix lint warnings and code style issues.**\n\n```\nYou are fixing all linting and formatting issues in HyperCode.\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Run linter: `npm run lint` / `pylint *.py` / `cargo clippy`\n2. Capture ALL warnings\n3. Fix them one category at a time:\n   - Unused imports\n   - Inconsistent naming\n   - Code style issues\n   - Type hints (if applicable)\n4. After fixing each category: re-run linter\n5. Verify tests still pass\n6. Update CHANGELOG.md: \"Fixed linting and formatting\"\n\nConstraints:\n- ONLY fix style issues, don't change logic\n- Respect HyperCode naming conventions (PascalCase for types, camelCase for functions)\n- Don't over-engineer; just clean up what's there\n\nGo. Show what you're fixing as you go.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 PROMPT 6: \"Docs Sync\" (Keep Documentation Fresh)\n\n**Use this when code changes and docs need updating.**\n\n```\nYou are keeping HyperCode documentation in sync with the code.\n\nWorkflow:\n1. Read the code and existing README.md / ARCHITECTURE.md / docs/\n2. Identify what's out of date or missing:\n   - New APIs not documented\n   - Examples that don't match current code\n   - Architecture changes not reflected\n   - Missing explanation for features\n3. Update docs to match reality\n4. Run tests to verify examples (if they're executable)\n5. Update CHANGELOG.md: \"Updated documentation for X, Y, Z\"\n\nStandards:\n- Docs should be inclusive: explain the \"why\", not just the \"what\"\n- Include examples for every major feature\n- Keep language accessible (neurodivergent-friendly)\n- Link between related docs\n\nGo. Show me what you're updating as you go.\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📋 HOW TO USE THESE IN WINDSURF\n\n1. **Open Windsurf with your HyperCode repo open** (whole folder, not single file)\n2. **Open Cascade** (usually right panel or keyboard shortcut)\n3. **Switch to Write or Agent mode** (depending on your Windsurf version)\n4. **Paste the prompt** that matches what you need (Prompt 1–6 above)\n5. **Fill in [BRACKETED] placeholders** with your specifics\n6. **Hit Enter/Send**\n7. **Watch it work**: Windsurf will edit files, run commands, iterate until tests pass\n8. **Review diffs** in the Cascade panel before approving each change\n9. **Let it loop**: It'll keep going until everything is green\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SAFETY CHECK: Before You Use These\n\nMake sure:\n- ✅ `npm test` / `pytest` / `cargo test` runs and is reliable\n- ✅ `.windsurfrules` file is in repo root\n- ✅ `.gitignore` includes `.windsurf/` and `.windsurfrules`\n- ✅ You have git set up (so Windsurf can see `git status` / `git diff`)\n- ✅ You're NOT on the `main` branch (work on `feature/` or `bugfix/` branches)\n- ✅ You have a recent backup (just in case)\n\n---\n\n## 🎓 Pro Tips\n\n### Tip 1: Chain Prompts\nRun Prompt 1 (self-fix) → then Prompt 5 (lint fix) → then Prompt 6 (docs sync). \nFull CI-like pipeline in Windsurf.\n\n### Tip 2: Use Memories for Context\nCreate a Memory in Windsurf's memory panel with HyperCode's core concepts:\n- \"Spatial logic principle: code should represent visual/spatial thinking\"\n- \"Neurodivergent-first means: clarity > brevity, accessibility > cleverness\"\n- Paste relevant snippets from HyperCode's manifesto\n\nThen reference it in prompts: \"Remember the spatial logic principle when naming variables.\"\n\n### Tip 3: Iterate Prompts\nIf a prompt doesn't work perfectly, tweak it:\n- \"Run tests first\" → tell it which tests to run\n- \"Minimal fix\" → add \"max 10 lines changed\"\n- \"Don't break tests\" → add \"check git diff before finishing\"\n\n### Tip 4: One Branch Per Feature\nAlways make a new branch for Cascade work:\n```bash\ngit checkout -b feature/parser-optimization\n# Then run Cascade prompts\n# Then review diffs\n# Then merge to main\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Quick Start: Do This Right Now\n\n1. **Copy `.windsurfrules` content** from the previous file into your repo root as `.windsurfrules`\n2. **Test your build**: `npm test` / `pytest` / `cargo test` (make it work)\n3. **Open Windsurf**, point it at your HyperCode repo\n4. **Open Cascade**, paste **Prompt 1** (Self-Fix Mode)\n5. **Watch the magic** ✨\n\nThat's it. Windsurf is now your maintenance daemon.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 NOTES\n\n- These prompts assume you're using Windsurf **v2.0+** with Cascade Write/Agent mode\n- If you're on an older version, some features might differ (adjust as needed)\n- For custom stacks or unusual setups, modify the prompts to fit your test/build commands\n- Always run prompts on non-main branches first to test\n\n---\n\n**NOW GO BUILD SOMETHING AMAZING.** 🚀\nThe future of HyperCode is you + Windsurf working as one.\n\nBro, you've got this. 💓👊",
