It combines forgotten esoteric\nlanguage concepts with modern AI integration and neurodivergent-first design principles.\n\nThink of it as: **Brainfuck meets modern JavaScript, designed by people with ADHD.**\n\n### Why do we need another programming language?\n\nExcellent question! Most programming languages were designed by neurotypical people, for\nneurotypical brains. They often feature:\n\n- Dense, noisy syntax that overwhelms dyslexic readers\n- Rigid structures that don't match ADHD thought patterns\n- Assumptions about \"normal\" learning styles\n- Zero accessibility considerations\n\nHyperCode flips this: **It's designed by and for neurodivergent minds first**, then made\nuniversally accessible.\n\n### Is HyperCode production-ready?\n\n**No, not yet.** We're in Phase 1 (Foundation), targeting v0.1 release in early 2026 and\nv1.0 stable release in mid-2026. That said, we welcome early adopters, feedback, and\ncontributions!\n\n### Can I use HyperCode for real projects?\n\nCurrently, HyperCode is **experimental**. Use it for:\n\n- Learning and exploration\n- Contributing to the project\n- Fun and creative experiments\n- Educational purposes\n\n**Not recommended (yet) for:**\n\n- Production systems\n- Mission-critical applications\n- Commercial products (until v1.0)\n\n### How is HyperCode different from Python, JavaScript, or Rust?\n\n| Aspect                             | HyperCode   | Python | JavaScript | Rust   |\n| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |\n| **Neurodivergent-First**           | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |\n| **AI-Native**                      | ✅ Built-in | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |\n| **Accessible Design**              | ✅ Priority | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |\n| **Inspired by Esoteric Languages** | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |\n| **Dyslexia-Friendly**              | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No  | ❌ No      | ❌ No  |\n| **Production-Ready**               | 🔄 Soon     | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes |\n\n---\n\n## Neurodiversity & Accessibility\n\n### I'm neurodivergent. Will HyperCode actually work for my brain?\n\n**We're building it with you in mind.** That said:\n\n- If something _doesn't_ work for you, **tell us**. We'll fix it.\n- Early feedback from neurodivergent developers is crucial.\n- Different neurodivergent brains work differently—there's no one-size-fits-all\n  solution.\n\nHyperCode aims to be more accessible than mainstream languages, but it's not magic. If\nyou have specific needs or suggestions, open an issue or discussion!\n\n### What if I'm neurotypical? Can I still use HyperCode?\n\n**Absolutely!** HyperCode is designed _for_ neurodivergent minds but _welcoming to\neveryone_. Neurotypical developers often find the clean, visual syntax refreshing and\nproductive too.\n\n### Will HyperCode help with my ADHD/autism/dyslexia?\n\nHyperCode is designed with these conditions in mind, featuring:\n\n- **For ADHD**: Clear structure, visual flow, less cognitive load\n- **For Dyslexia**: Clean fonts, high contrast, minimal visual noise\n- **For Autism**: Logical patterns, explicit rules, minimal ambiguity\n\nBut we can't promise it will \"fix\" your condition. What we _can_ promise: **We're\nbuilding something that doesn't work _against_ your brain.**\n\n### How accessible is the documentation?\n\nWe're prioritizing accessibility from day one:\n\n- ✅ Screen reader tested\n- ✅ Dyslexia-friendly fonts\n- ✅ Captions on video tutorials (coming soon)\n- ✅ Alt text on all diagrams\n- ✅ Multiple explanation formats\n- ✅ Accessible color contrast\n\n**Issues with accessibility? Report them\n[here](https://github.com/HyperCode-Labs/HyperCode/issues).**\n\n---\n\n## Technical Questions\n\n### What's the tech stack?\n\n- **Language**: TypeScript (compiles to JavaScript)\n- **Runtime**: Node.js 16+\n- **Parser**: Custom lexer and AST-based parser\n- **AI Integration**: REST/WebSocket APIs\n- **Testing**: Jest\n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions\n- **Build**: npm\n\n### Can HyperCode run in the browser?\n\n**Eventually, yes!** Currently it runs on Node.js. We're planning browser support in\nPhase 2 (Q1-Q2 2026).\n\n### How do I install HyperCode?\n\nOnce released (v0.1+):\n\n```bash\nnpm install hypercode\n```\n\nFor now, clone the repo and follow [Getting Started guide](../docs/getting-started.md).\n\n### Can I compile HyperCode to JavaScript/Python/Rust?\n\n**Yes, that's the plan!** HyperCode can transpile to multiple languages, making it a\nbridge between the future and existing ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n## AI Integration\n\n### What AI platforms does HyperCode support?\n\n**Phase 2 integrations (coming Q1-Q2 2026):**\n\n- GPT-4/4o\n- Claude 3+\n- Mistral\n- Ollama (local models)\n- Custom LLM frameworks\n\nCurrently, HyperCode is designed to be AI-compatible but integrations aren't live yet.\n\n### Can HyperCode generate code with AI?\n\n**Yes, that's part of the vision!** Features like `THINK-WITH ChatGPT` will let you\ncollaborate with AI directly in your code. But this is Phase 2.\n\n### Is my code sent to external AI services?\n\n**No.** HyperCode respects your privacy. You control:\n\n- Which AI platform you use (or run your own local model)\n- Whether code is sent anywhere\n- How your data is handled\n\n---\n\n## Contributing & Community\n\n### I want to contribute.

We investigate impartially and enforce\nconsequences.\n\n---\n\n## Licensing & Legals\n\n### Is HyperCode open source?\n\n**Yes!** HyperCode is released under the **MIT License**. You can use it freely, modify\nit, sell it—no permission needed.\n\n### Can I use HyperCode commercially?\n\n**Yes.** MIT license allows commercial use. No licensing fees.\n\n### Do I have to open-source my HyperCode code?\n\n**No.** You can write proprietary HyperCode code. MIT doesn't require you to open-source\nderivatives.\n\n### What about patents?\n\nNo patent claims. HyperCode is designed for freedom and accessibility, not corporate\nlock-in.\n\n---\n\n## Learning & Resources\n\n### Where do I learn HyperCode?\n\n1. **[Getting Started Guide](../docs/getting-started.md)** — Your entry point\n2. **[Language Reference](../docs/language-reference.md)** — Complete syntax\n3. **[Interactive Playground](https://hypercode.dev/playground)** (coming Q1 2026)\n4. **[YouTube Tutorials](https://youtube.com/@hypercode-official)** (coming Q1 2026)\n5. **[Community Discussions](https://github.com/HyperCode-Labs/HyperCode/discussions)**\n   — Ask anything\n\n### Is there a HyperCode community?\n\n**Yes!** Find us:\n\n- **GitHub Discussions**: Ask questions, share projects\n- **Discord** (coming Q1 2026)\n- **Twitter** (coming soon)\n- **Community Calls**: Monthly (starting Q1 2026)\n\n### Can I get paid to work on HyperCode?\n\n**Possibly.** Currently, all work is voluntary.
