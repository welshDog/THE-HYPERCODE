  "content": "# 💬 HyperCode Developer Interview Template\n\n> **User research guide for understanding developer needs and testing HyperCode**\n\n## 🎯 Purpose\n\nThis template helps you gather feedback from developers about:\n- Their current coding pain points\n- What they need from a programming language\n- How HyperCode feels to use\n- What would make them switch\n\n**Use this for:**\n- Beta tester interviews\n- User research sessions\n- Community feedback\n- Product validation\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Interview Guide (Live / DM / Text)\n\n### Intro (Short + Friendly)\n\n\"Hey! I'm collecting feedback for a new neurodivergent-friendly language + dev environment called **HyperCode**.\n\nMind if I ask you a few questions about how you code and what your dream setup would look like? 🙌\n\n**This should take about 10-15 minutes.**\"\n\n---\n\n## 1️⃣ How You Code Right Now\n\n### Q1. What languages and tools do you use most day to day?\n*(e.g. Python + VS Code, JS + WebStorm, Neovim, JetBrains, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)*\n\n**Why we ask:** Understand their baseline and what we're competing with.\n\n---\n\n### Q2. What do you like most about your current setup or main language?\n- What feels smooth or enjoyable?\n- What keeps you using it instead of switching?\n\n**Why we ask:** Learn what features are must-haves.\n\n---\n\n### Q3. What's the most annoying part of your current coding setup or language?\nWhere do you feel the most friction, frustration, or boredom?\n\n**Why we ask:** Identify pain points HyperCode can solve.\n\n---\n\n### Q4. Which features, plugins, or tools do you rely on so much you'd hate to lose them?\n*(e.g. Copilot, autocomplete/LSP, linters, refactor tools, test runners, debugger, etc.)*\n\n**Why we ask:** Know what's non-negotiable for adoption.\n\n---\n\n## 2️⃣ Your Ideal Programming Language\n\n### Q5. If you could design your perfect programming language, what would it do better than what you use now?\n*(Think: speed, errors, readability, creativity, focus, fun.)*\n\n**Why we ask:** Understand aspirations beyond current tools.\n\n---\n\n### Q6. What kinds of mistakes should the language catch or prevent for you?\n*(e.g. type errors, off-by-one bugs, null/undefined, async bugs, misuse of APIs, etc.)*\n\n**Why we ask:** Prioritize error handling and safety features.\n\n---\n\n### Q7. What do you wish writing code felt like?\nPick one or describe your own:\n- 💬 Chatting with a helpful friend\n- 🎨 Sketching or drawing\n- 🧩 Wiring blocks together\n- 📖 Writing a story or script\n- 🧠 Solving puzzles\n- ✨ Something else: _________\n\n**Why we ask:** Understand the emotional experience they want.\n\n---\n\n## 3️⃣ HyperCode Specifically\n\n### Q8. If HyperCode became your main language, what problems would you want it to solve for you first?\n*(Rant welcome: bugs, confusion, focus, boredom, context switching, etc.)*\n\n**Why we ask:** Prioritize feature roadmap based on real needs.\n\n---\n\n### Q9. Which features would make HyperCode an instant daily driver for you?\n\"If it had X, I'd use it every day, no question.\"\n\n**Why we ask:** Identify the killer features that drive adoption.\n\n---\n\n### Q10. When you get stuck, how should HyperCode help you?\nChoose any that sound good (and add your own):\n- 🔍 Concrete examples\n- 👀 Visual hints / diagrams\n- 🤖 Step-by-step AI explanations\n- 🛠️ Auto-fixes with explanations\n- 🧩 Suggesting alternative approaches\n- 💬 Chat-style Q&A inside the editor\n- ✨ Other: _________\n\n**Why we ask:** Design the AI assistance and error handling.\n\n---\n\n## 4️⃣ UX, Feel & HyperCode Experience\n\n**Note:** Use these questions *after* they've tried a small HyperCode task.\n\n### Q11. On a scale of 1–10, how easy was it to understand and write HyperCode in this task?\n\n1 = \"Totally lost\" ────────────────────────────────── 10 = \"Clicked instantly\"\n\n[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]\n\n**Why we ask:** Measure learnability quantitatively.\n\n---\n\n### Q12. What felt confusing, heavy, or mentally tiring when using HyperCode?\n- Any parts of the syntax?\n- Any concepts or rules that felt like \"too much\"?\n\n**Why we ask:** Identify cognitive load issues.\n\n---\n\n### Q13. If you could change one thing about the HyperCode editor or syntax, what would it be, and why?\n*(This could be visuals, layout, keywords, emoji use, error messages, anything.)*\n\n**Why we ask:** Get specific improvement suggestions.\n\n---\n\n### Q14. How did using HyperCode feel compared to your normal coding?\n- More fun / less fun?\n- More focus / more distraction?\n- More or less \"in flow\"?\n\n**Why we ask:** Understand the emotional and cognitive experience.\n\n---\n\n## 5️⃣ Optional: Anything Else?\n\n### Q15. Is there anything you'd love HyperCode to do that we haven't asked about yet?\n*(Wild ideas very welcome. 🚀)*\n\n**Why we ask:** Capture unexpected insights and creative ideas.\n\n---\n\n## 🎬 Closing\n\n\"**Thank you so much for your time!** 🙏\n\nYour feedback is incredibly valuable and will directly shape how HyperCode evolves.\n\nWould you be interested in:\n- [ ] Beta testing HyperCode when it's ready?\n- [ ] Being credited as a contributor in our docs?\n- [ ] Getting early access to new features?\n\nStay in touch: [Discord / Email / GitHub]\"\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Example Answers (Reference)\n\n### Sample Response from a Mid-Senior Developer\n\n**Q1. Languages & tools**\n> Mostly TypeScript + React in VS Code. Some Python for scripts. Tools: VS Code, GitHub Copilot, GitLens, Prettier, ESLint, Jest, Docker.\n\n**Q2. What I like most**\n> TS catches a ton of errors early. VS Code feels snappy. Copilot makes boring stuff disappear. I like that my tests and linting run in the background so I can stay in flow.\n\n**Q3. Most annoying parts**\n> Messy async bugs. Context switching between files kills my focus. Reading huge error messages that don't tell me where to look first. Also wiring tooling together sucks (config hell).\n\n**Q4. Features I'd hate to lose**\n> Copilot, good autocomplete, jump-to-definition, inline errors, and a proper debugger. If I lost refactor tools (rename symbol, extract function), I'd cry.\n\n**Q5. Perfect language: what it would do better**\n> Make intent super clear. Less boilerplate, more \"say what I want.\" Built-in support for async flows, not bolted on. Super readable even 6 months later. It would help me structure code so I don't create a ball of mud.\n\n**Q6. Mistakes it should catch**\n> - Type errors & null issues\n> - Off-by-one / bounds\n> - Misused async (forgot await, wrong error handling)\n> - \"You're duplicating this logic in 3 places\"\n> - \"This API call isn't handled if it fails\"\n\n**Q7. What coding should feel like**\n> Chatting with a helpful friend plus solving puzzles. I want it to feel like we're co-piloting a ship, not me fighting a compiler.\n\n**Q8. Problems I'd want HyperCode to solve first**\n> - Reduce context switching (show me related code + data together)\n> - Make tricky bugs more explainable\n> - Help me keep a clean architecture over time\n> - Kill boring boilerplate and wiring\n\n**Q9. \"Instant daily driver\" features**\n> - First-class AI that understands my whole project, not just one file\n> - One-click refactors with clear previews\n> - Visual map of my codebase I can zoom around\n> - Smart suggestions like \"this function is doing too much – want to split it?\"\n\n**Q10. How I want help when stuck**\n> ✅ Concrete examples  \n> ✅ Visual diagrams of the flow  \n> ✅ Step-by-step explanations  \n> ✅ Auto-fix with \"here's why this works\"  \n> ✅ Alternative approaches (simple vs advanced)  \n> ✅ Chat inside the editor tied to the current code\n\n**Q11. Ease of using HyperCode**\n> I'd say 7/10. Concepts were cool but I needed a bit more guidance at first.\n\n**Q12. What felt heavy**\n> Remembering all the emoji meanings at once was a bit much. I needed more inline hints/tooltips.\n\n**Q13. One change I'd make**\n> Hover hints over emojis and keywords that explain \"this usually means X\" with a tiny example. That would make it easier to learn by doing.\n\n**Q14. Compared to normal coding**\n> More fun, honestly. Less \"type noise\", more feeling like building with blocks. I felt more in flow once I got it, but the first 5–10 minutes were a bit cognitively heavy.\n\n**Q15. Extra wish**\n> A \"learning mode\" where the system plays back what I just wrote as a little story/diagram: \"Here's what your program does, step by step.\" That would be amazing.\n\n---\n\n## 📱 Next Steps\n\n### After the Interview\n\n1. **Thank them** - Send a thank you message within 24 hours\n2. **Document insights** - Add to your research notes\n3. **Follow up** - Invite to beta test if interested\n4. **Iterate** - Use feedback to improve HyperCode\n\n### Research Best Practices\n\n- **Record** - Ask permission to record (for notes, not sharing)\n- **Listen** - Don't defend or explain, just understand\n- **Probe** - Ask \"why?\" and \"can you give an example?\"\n- **Stay neutral** - Don't lead with your opinions\n- **Time box** - Respect their time, stick to 15-20 mins max\n\n---\n\n[Google Forms Version](DEV_INTERVIEW_FORMS.md) | [Outreach Templates](DEV_INTERVIEW_OUTREACH.md) | [Beta Testing Guide](BETA_TESTER_GUIDE.md)",
