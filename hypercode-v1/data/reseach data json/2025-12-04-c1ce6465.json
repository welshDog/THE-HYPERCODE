  "summary": "Visuospatial coding scaffolds cognition; code canvas & spatial layout improve comprehension for high visuo-spatial working memory devs.",
  "details": "Visuospatial reference frames found throughout visual cortex & non-visual brain areas. Code-to-concept maps: spatial proximity aids navigation & comprehension. Research: code canvas (free arrangement) vs tab-based visualization; developers with high visuo-spatial working memory benefit from spatial representations. Mental rotation problems activate similar brain areas as tree data structures. Spatial Encoding Strategy (SpES) theory: spatial skills transfer to programming strategies. Neuroimaging shows shared activation patterns."
