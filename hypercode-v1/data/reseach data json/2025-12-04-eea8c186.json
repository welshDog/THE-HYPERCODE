  "summary": "DNA computing uses strand displacement, DNAzymes, toehold exchange for logic gates; compiles from C-like CRN level.",
  "details": "Full stack: C-like language → Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) → Domain-level DNA design → DNA strands. Methods: strand displacement reactions (SDRs), toehold exchange (creates AND/OR/NOT modular gates), DNAzymes (E6, 8-17 for catalytic reactions). 2010: Winfree showed DNA implements arbitrary chemical reactions. Domain-specific languages for DNA circuits enabling simulation & design automation."
