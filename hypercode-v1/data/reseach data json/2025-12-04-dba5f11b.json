  "details": "Core principles: Transparency (code inspection), Community Contribution (diverse perspectives), Accessibility (no licensing barriers). Git/GitHub revolutionized version control (2008+). Community support: fast issue resolution, mentorship, documentation. Best practices: start small, engage on forums/Slack, follow coding standards. Sustainability: governance models, contributor mentorship, regular updates. Projects like React, Linux, Ruby on Rails demonstrate power of collaborative development. DevOps & CI/CD essential for quality & versioning."
