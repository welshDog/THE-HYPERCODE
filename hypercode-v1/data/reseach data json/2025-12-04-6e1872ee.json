  "summary": "Befunge is 2D stack-based esoteric language created 1993 by Chris Pressey, designed to be maximally hard to compile.",
  "details": "Befunge code executes on 80x25 grid with directional instructions (>, <, ^, v). Stack-based operations with 25+ commands including arithmetic, I/O, self-modifying code. Befunge-98 extended to arbitrary dimensions (Trefunge for 3D) and achieved Turing-completeness. Influenced by Forth & Lemmings. Powers IRC bot fungot. Concepts: playfield, instruction pointer with inertia, stack operations."
