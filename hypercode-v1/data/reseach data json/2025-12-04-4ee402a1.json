  "summary": "Ergonomic syntax: shorter keywords for frequent constructs, consistency, avoid weirdness budget, use precedent.",
  "details": "Design principles: Frequency inversely proportional to keystrokes (common ops = short syntax). Use nouns for objects, verbs for operators. Avoid prefix/infix/postfix confusion. Don't break precedent without reason - users adopt for features, not syntax. Consider visuo-spatial proximity: related concepts should be near. Minimize cognitive load for ADHD/dyslexia (avoid long lines >80 chars, avoid justified text, clear structure). Accessibility: readable fonts, semantic structure, screen reader support."
