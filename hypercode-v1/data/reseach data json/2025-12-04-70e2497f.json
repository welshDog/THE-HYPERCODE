  "summary": "Quantum languages: Qiskit (IBM), Q# (Microsoft), Cirq (Google), Guppy (Quantinuum) for quantum circuit design.",
  "details": "Quantum languages divided into Imperative (QCL, Q#, Silq, Guppy) & Functional (QPL, Quipper, funQ). Qiskit built on Python with circuits/algorithms. Q# supports classical flow control & measurement-dependent quantum ops. Cirq handles NISQ computers with wave-function & density-matrix simulators. Guppy is quantum-first, Python-embedded, designed for error correction & dynamic programs. Most rely on Python base for accessibility."
