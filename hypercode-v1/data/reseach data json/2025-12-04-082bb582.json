  "details": "Autistic excel at math/logic, structured systems. ADHD show hyperfocus on interesting tasks, seek sensory stimulation, need movement for concentration. Dyslexic demonstrate advanced spatial reasoning, creativity, lateral thinking - Richard Branson credits dyslexia for creative advantage. Code rewards these strengths: clear literal instructions (no social ambiguity), pattern recognition, visual structure. Block-based (Scratch) → Python transition works well. Needs: clear expectations, adapted pacing, written instructions."
