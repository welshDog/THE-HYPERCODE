## 🐦 Twitter/X DM Template

**Subject:** (No subject needed for DMs)

**Message:**
```
Hey! 👋

I saw you're into [language/framework they tweet about] and thought you might have good insights.

I'm building HyperCode — a programming language designed for neurodivergent developers (ADHD, dyslexia, autism, etc.). Would love your thoughts on what sucks about current languages and what you'd want instead.

Quick 10-15 min chat? (async via DM is totally cool too)

No pressure! Just collecting feedback from devs who actually code.

Interested? 🚀
```

**Follow-up if interested:**
```
Awesome! Here's what I'm curious about:

1. What language/tools do you use daily?
2. What's the most annoying part?
3. If you could design the perfect language, what would it do?

Feel free to answer in DMs or I can send you a quick form 👍

## 💬 Discord DM Template

**Message:**
```
Hey! 👋

I'm doing user research for a neurodivergent-friendly programming language called HyperCode.

Saw you in [server name] and thought you might have useful feedback about coding tools/languages.

Would you be down for a super casual 10-15 min chat about:
• What you code with now
• What drives you nuts about it
• What your dream language would look like

Can do it async (just answer when you have time) or hop on a quick call if you prefer!

No worries if you're busy — just thought I'd ask 😊
```

**Follow-up:**
```
Sweet! Here are the questions: [paste questions or link]

Answer whenever — no rush! And feel free to rant, honest feedback is gold 💛

## 🔴 Reddit PM Template

**Subject:** Quick feedback on a new programming language?

**Message:**
```
Hey u/[username]!

I saw your comment in r/[subreddit] about [topic they mentioned] and it really resonated.

I'm building HyperCode — a programming language specifically designed for neurodivergent developers. The goal is to reduce cognitive load and make coding more accessible for ADHD, dyslexic, and autistic brains (though it helps everyone tbh).

Would you be interested in answering a few questions about what frustrates you about current languages and what you'd want instead?

It's about 10-15 minutes and I can send you the questions here or via a form — whatever's easier.

Either way, thanks for sharing your thoughts on Reddit. It's helpful even just reading posts like yours!

Cheers,
[Your name]

## 💼 LinkedIn Message Template

**Subject:** Feedback on neurodivergent-friendly programming language?

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I came across your profile and saw you work with [language/tech they mention].

I'm conducting user research for HyperCode, a new programming language designed specifically for neurodivergent developers. We're focusing on reducing cognitive load and making coding more accessible for ADHD, dyslexic, and autistic minds.

I'd love to get your perspective on:
• Pain points in your current dev setup
• Features that would make a language feel "just right"
• How you'd want a language to help when you're stuck

Would you be open to a brief 10-15 minute conversation? Happy to do it over a call or async via message.

No pressure — just reaching out to developers who might have valuable insights!

Best,
[Your name]

## 🐙 GitHub Discussions Post

**Title:** 🧠 User Research: Help Shape HyperCode!

**Post:**
```markdown
## 👋 Hey GitHub Community!

I'm building **HyperCode** — a programming language designed specifically for neurodivergent developers (ADHD, dyslexia, autism, etc.).

### 🎯 Why This Matters

Most languages are designed for neurotypical brains. They punish context-switching, use cryptic syntax, and have unpredictable behaviors. HyperCode aims to fix that.

### 💡 I Need Your Help

I'm looking for developers to interview about:
- What frustrates you about current languages/tools
- What your ideal programming language would do
- How you want help when you're stuck

**Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Format:** Async (answer when you have time) or live chat

### 🚀 Interested?

Drop a comment or DM me!

You'll get:
- Early access to HyperCode
- Credit as a contributor
- Input on roadmap decisions

Thanks for considering! 🙏

## 📧 Email Template (Cold Outreach)

**Subject:** Quick question about your coding workflow?

**Email:**
```
Hi [Name],

I came across your [blog post/talk/project] on [topic] and really appreciated your perspective on [specific thing they said].

I'm conducting user research for HyperCode, a programming language designed for neurodivergent developers. The goal is to reduce cognitive friction and make coding more accessible for ADHD, dyslexic, and autistic minds.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on:
• What frustrates you about current programming languages
• Features that would make you switch to a new language
• How you prefer to get help when you're stuck

Would you be open to a quick 10-15 minute conversation? We can do it over Zoom, phone, or just via email if that's easier.

No worries if you're too busy — I know your time is valuable!

Thanks for considering,
[Your name]

P.S. Here's more about HyperCode if you're curious: [link to repo]

## 🎯 Community Post Template

**For: r/ADHD, r/neurodiversity, r/learnprogramming, etc.**

**Title:** 🧠 Building a programming language for neurodivergent brains — need your input!

**Post:**
```markdown
Hey everyone! 👋

I'm a [neurodivergent type] developer building **HyperCode** — a programming language specifically designed for how neurodivergent brains work.

## 🤔 The Problem

Most programming languages were designed for neurotypical brains. They're full of:
- Context-switching hell (ADHD nightmare)
- Cryptic symbols and syntax (dyslexia frustration)
- Unpredictable behaviors (autism anxiety)

## ✨ The Goal

Make a language that works WITH neurodivergent minds:
- Natural language syntax (reads like English)
- Immediate, visual feedback (less working memory load)
- Predictable, explicit behavior (no surprises)
- AI-powered help (pair programming built-in)

## 💬 I Need Your Help!

If you code (or want to learn), I'd love to interview you about:
1. What makes current languages hard for you
2. What would make coding easier/more enjoyable
3. How you'd want help when stuck

**Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Format:** Whatever works for you (DM, voice, async)

## 🎯 What You Get

- Early access to HyperCode
- Credit as a contributor
- Influence on what gets built
- Help shape a tool that could change coding for ND people

Interested? Comment or DM me!

Thanks for reading 🙏

## 📈 Response Rate Tips

### What Works

✅ **Personalize** - Reference something specific about them  
✅ **Be brief** - Respect their time  
✅ **Offer value** - Early access, credit, influence  
✅ **Make it easy** - Async option, short time commitment  
✅ **Be genuine** - Don't sound like a sales pitch  

### What Doesn't Work

❌ Generic copy-paste messages  
❌ Long-winded explanations  
❌ Asking for too much time  
❌ No clear benefit to them  
❌ Overly formal or salesy tone  

---

## 📊 Tracking & Follow-up

### Keep Track Of

- Who you contacted (name, platform, date)
- Their response (interested, declined, no response)
- Interview completed (yes/no, date)
- Key insights from interview
- Follow-up needed (beta invite, thank you, etc.)

### Follow-up Timeline

**Day 1:** Send initial outreach  
**Day 3-4:** If no response, gentle follow-up  
**Day 7:** Final follow-up if still no response  
**After that:** Move on, don't be pushy  

### Example Follow-up

```
Hey! Just wanted to follow up on my message about HyperCode feedback.

Totally understand if you're busy — no worries either way!

But if you're interested, I'd still love to hear your thoughts. Even just 5 minutes would be super helpful.

Cheers! 👋

## 🎯 Goal: 20-30 Interviews

**Aim for diversity:**
- 40% neurodivergent developers
- 30% beginners, 40% intermediate, 30% advanced
- Mix of languages (Python, JS, Rust, etc.)
- Mix of domains (web, data, systems, etc.)

**Quality over quantity:**
- Better to have 10 deep interviews than 30 surface-level ones
- Ask follow-up questions
- Record (with permission) for later analysis
- Take detailed notes
