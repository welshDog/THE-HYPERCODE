# 🚀 Community Brainstorm: HyperCode's First Superpower

Hey everyone! We've been building HyperCode to make programming more accessible for neurodivergent developers. Now we need YOUR help deciding what feature to prioritize next.

## 🎯 The Challenge
We can only focus on ONE major feature right now. What would be most valuable for YOU?

## 🤔 Option A: Instant Visual Debugging 🐛
- See your code execute step-by-step with visual highlights
- Perfect for ADHD minds that need to see the flow
- Like having a pair programmer that shows you exactly what's happening

## 🤔 Option B: Smart Code Completion with Context 🧠
- AI-powered suggestions that understand your intent
- Learns your coding style and patterns
- Reduces cognitive load by predicting what you need next

## 🤔 Option C: Real-Time Collaboration Mode 👥
- Code together in real-time like Google Docs
- Built for pair programming and study groups
- Visual indicators show who's changing what

## 🤔 Option D: One-Click Deployment 🚀
- Turn your HyperCode into a live web app instantly
- No setup, no configuration, just click and share
- Great for showing off your work without the headache
