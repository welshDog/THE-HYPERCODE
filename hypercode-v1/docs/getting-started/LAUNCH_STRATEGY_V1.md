## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Low initial interest
**Mitigation:** Focus on neurodivergent communities first, not general tech audience

### Risk: Negative feedback on "why another language"
**Response:** "This isn't for everyone. It's specifically for neurodivergent developers who struggle with existing languages."

### Risk: Technical issues on launch day
**Mitigation:** Thorough beta testing, have bug fix ready to deploy fast

### Risk: Burnout managing everything solo
**Mitigation:** Recruit co-maintainers from beta testers, set boundaries
