# Introducing HyperCode: Built for Neurodivergent Minds

I built a programming language designed specifically for how neurodivergent 
brains actually work.

## The Problem
- Traditional languages have high cognitive load
- Syntax is arbitrary and cryptic
- Accessibility is an afterthought

## HyperCode is Different
- **2D spatial layout** (visual thinking support)
- **40% fewer tokens** than Python (less mental overhead)
- **WCAG AAA accessible** from day 1
- **Multi-AI native** (Claude, GPT-4, Mistral)

### r/ADHD

# I Built a Programming Language for Our Brains

As someone with ADHD, I struggled for years with traditional programming 
languages. The arbitrary syntax, context switching penalties, high cognitive 
load... it was exhausting.

So I built HyperCode—a language that respects how ADHD brains actually work:

- Less mental overhead
- Pattern-based thinking support
- Visual spatial layout option
- Works better with hyperfocus sessions

Not just ADHD—designed for autism, dyslexia, and everyone who thinks differently.

Would love feedback from the community!

## Twitter Thread (8 Tweets)

**Tweet 1:**
```
I spent 6 months building a programming language 
for neurodivergent brains. Not because I wanted to,
but because I had to. Traditional languages hurt.

HyperCode is the solution I wish existed. 🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem: Traditional programming has 3 attacks 
on neurodivergent brains:
1. High cognitive load (arbitrary syntax)
2. Context-switching penalties
3. Zero accessibility

Why would anyone use that?
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
HyperCode is different:
- 2D spatial code layout (matches pattern thinking)
- 40% fewer tokens vs Python
- WCAG AAA accessible
- Works with any AI (Claude, GPT, Mistral)

It's not just different. It's better.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Featuring forgotten programming paradigms:
- Befunge (2D spatial thinking)
- Plankalkül (forgotten genius)
- Modern AI optimization

We're resurrecting the past to build the future.

Looking for:
- Early adopters (try it, give feedback)
- Contributors (Python/JS/Rust)
- Researchers (neurodivergent design)
- Advocates (tell your friends)

Reply if interested 👇

**Tweet 7:**
```
This isn't just a language. It's a movement.

Proving software can be designed FOR humans,
not AGAINST them.

Proving neurodivergent brains aren't the problem—
the tools are.

Let's fix that.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
Open source. Community-driven. Radically accessible.
