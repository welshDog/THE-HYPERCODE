   forgotten languages (Plankalkül, Brainfuck, Befunge, Whitespace)

2. **Neurodivergent-First Design**
   Built from the ground up FOR how neurodivergent brains work,
   not adapted after-the-fact

3. **Context-Aware Errors**
   Errors explain WHAT happened, WHY it happened, and HOW to fix it
   (breakthrough in error message design)

4. **Confidence Tracking**
   System learns user skill level and adapts guidance automatically
   (adaptive user experience based on behavior)

5. **AI-First Architecture**
   Designed from beginning for multi-model AI integration
   (Claude, GPT-4, Mistral, Ollama, custom models)

6. **Participatory Development**
   Neurodivergent developers as co-creators, not test subjects
   (ethical inclusion methodology)

7. **Living Documentation**
   Research integrates with codebase, auto-updates with new findings
   (living, breathing research system)
