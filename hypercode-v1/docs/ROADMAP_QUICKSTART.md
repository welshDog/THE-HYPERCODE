## 🌍 Vision Statement

> We're building programming languages for minds that think differently.
>
> Not "fixing" neurodivergence. Celebrating it. Not trying to make neurodivergent brains
> fit languages. But building languages that fit how neurodivergent minds actually work.
>
> HyperCode is radical inclusion at the language design level. Let's code like we think.
> 🚀
