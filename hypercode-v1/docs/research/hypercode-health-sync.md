## 4. Strategic Priorities (Next 30 Days)

### Priority 1: Lock In CI/CD (Week 1 – Dec 13–19) 🔴 URGENT

**Why:** Everything else depends on automated benchmarking.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Add `make benchmark` target (runs 5 key tests)
- [ ] Integrate into GitHub Actions / CI pipeline
- [ ] Set performance regression threshold (e.g., fail if >5% slowdown)
- [ ] Dashboard: track metrics over time (graph execution time, memory, GC)
- [ ] Slack/email alerts on regression

**Deliverable:** Automated perf monitoring active by Dec 19  
**Effort:** 2–3 days  
**Owner:** You  
**Blocker:** None

---

### Priority 2: HyperDatabase Telemetry Integration (Week 1–2 – Dec 15–26) 🟡 HIGH

**Why:** Intelligence Loop doesn't work without data.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Set up HyperDatabase instance (local or cloud)
- [ ] Define telemetry schema (execution_metrics, function_profiles, variable_profiles, error_profiles)
- [ ] Add lightweight telemetry hooks to interpreter
- [ ] Test data ingestion (parse a sample HyperCode script, confirm metrics in DB)
- [ ] Create sample queries (hot paths, error patterns, recursion depths)

**Deliverable:** Telemetry flowing into HyperDatabase by Dec 26  
**Effort:** 1 week  
**Owner:** You  
**Blocker:** DB access / cloud setup

---

### Priority 3: AI Analysis Agent (Week 2–3 – Dec 20–Jan 2) 🟡 HIGH

**Why:** Closes the intelligence loop; enables self-optimization.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Write AI agent prompts (hot path detection, optimization proposals)
- [ ] Create scheduled job (daily/weekly analysis of telemetry)
- [ ] Generate reports: "Top 5 bottlenecks", "Suggested optimizations"
- [ ] Test: manually verify recommendations match data
- [ ] Integrate into GitHub Issues (auto-file issues for suggestions)

**Deliverable:** AI agent proposing optimizations by Jan 2  
**Effort:** 1–2 weeks  
**Owner:** You (+ AI agents)  
**Blocker:** Priority 2 complete

---

### Priority 4: Recursive-to-Iterative Rewrite (Week 3–4 – Jan 1–15) 🟡 HIGH

**Why:** Next 20–30% speedup; fixes RecursionError.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Design explicit evaluation stack
- [ ] Implement iterative interpreter (parallel to current)
- [ ] Test correctness (all existing tests pass)
- [ ] Benchmark: measure speedup
- [ ] Migrate users to new interpreter (with fallback)

**Deliverable:** New interpreter live by Jan 15  
**Effort:** 2–3 weeks  
**Owner:** You  
**Blocker:** Priority 1 active (need benchmarking to measure)

---

### Priority 5: HyperCode Studio (January) 🟡 MEDIUM

**Why:** Makes HyperCode an "AI-native dev experience."

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Create Antigravity workspace template for HyperCode
- [ ] Wire up telemetry dashboard (show hot nodes, regressions)
- [ ] Add agent: "Profile this script" → generates optimization report
- [ ] Launch private beta

**Deliverable:** Studio private beta by late January  
**Effort:** 2–3 weeks  
**Owner:** You (+ maybe Antigravity team collab)  
**Blocker:** Priorities 2–4 partially complete

## 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 5.1 High-Risk Items

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Recursive-to-iterative rewrite introduces bugs** | 🔴 High | Medium | Extensive testing; run both in parallel; slow rollout |
| **Telemetry overhead slows interpreter** | 🟡 Medium | Medium | Sample telemetry (1–5%); optimize telemetry code; profile separately |
| **HyperDatabase gets too large** | 🟡 Medium | Low | Set retention policy (keep last 90 days); archive old data; compress |
| **AI agent makes bad optimization proposals** | 🟡 Medium | Medium | Human review before merging; conservative thresholds; rollback plan |
| **Users opt out of telemetry** | 🟡 Medium | Medium | Make opt-in easy & transparent; show data value (faster runtimes) |

### 5.2 Mitigation Strategies

1. **Extensive Testing:**
   - Keep old and new interpreters running in parallel initially.
   - A/B test: compare outputs on same code.
   - Rollback plan: instant revert if critical bug found.

2. **Gradual Rollout:**
   - Ship iterative interpreter to beta users first (opt-in).
   - Gather feedback for 2 weeks.
   - GA rollout only after 0 critical bugs found in beta.

3. **Telemetry Sampling:**
   - Default: sample 2–5% of executions.
   - Users can opt for "full telemetry" if they want (for AI-driven optimizations).
   - Show users: "Thanks to your telemetry, we improved speed by 18%."

4. **AI Review Loop:**
   - AI proposes changes; humans review in GitHub.
   - Never auto-merge; always manual approval.
   - Each proposal includes: code, test, benchmark data, rollback plan.
