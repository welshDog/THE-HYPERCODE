# HyperCode Status Report

## ✅ Working
- [ ] Lexer can parse .hc files
- [ ] Web playground loads
- [ ] VS Code extension activates
- [ ] RAG system indexes code
- [ ] Accessibility formatters run

## 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] Full compiler (transpile to Python/JS?)
- [ ] AI optimization features
- [ ] Knowledge graph population

## 🔴 Not Started
- [ ] Quantum computing examples
- [ ] DNA computing patterns
Phase 3: Build Missing Links (Weeks 3-4)
Based on what you find, prioritize:

Option A: If Language Core is Weak
→ Focus on getting .hc → executable code working

Build transpiler (HyperCode → Python first)

Make examples actually run

Option B: If AI Layer is Weak
→ Hook up RAG properly

Connect to Perplexity/OpenAI APIs

Test semantic search on your codebase

Make AI suggestions actually work in VS Code

Option C: If Everything's Solid
→ Ship the playground publicly

Deploy to Vercel/Netlify

Create demo videos for TikTok/LinkedIn

Start building community around it

🚀 Quick Wins for Momentum
These give you immediate dopamine hits (ADHD-friendly):

30-Min Win: Get ONE .hc example to print "Hello World"

2-Hour Win: Record screen demo of web playground

1-Day Win: Write blog post "Why I'm Building an AI-Native Language"

1-Week Win: Get HyperCode trending on GitHub (ship something visual)

🧠 Why This Matters (The Big Picture)
You're not just building another tool, bro. You're building:

A language optimized for AI collaboration (like Python but for LLMs)​

A knowledge system that understands code context (RAG for devs)​

An accessible platform that neurodivergent devs will LOVE

2025 is THE year for AI-native dev tools. You're positioned perfectly.
