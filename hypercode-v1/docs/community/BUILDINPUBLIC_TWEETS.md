## 📅 Daily Progress Tweet Templates

### Day 1-2: Consolidation
```
Day 1/30: The Great Purge 🔥

Deleted 7 duplicate directories from HyperCode repo
- knowledge_graph/ → parking lot
- mcp/ → v0.4
- quantum stuff → v2.0

Repo is 50% smaller. ONE lexer, ONE parser, ONE path forward.

### Day 3-4: CLI
```
Day 3/30: CLI is alive! ⚡

`python -m hypercode --version` 
→ HyperCode v0.2.0 - Think Spatially 🧠⚡

`python -m hypercode hello.hc`
→ Hello, HyperCode!

Small wins = momentum 🚀

## 🎯 Week 2 Tweet Templates

### Sudoku Demo Progress
```
Week 2 progress: Spatial Sudoku solver 🧩

Traditional Python: Nested loops, ugly grid[i][j] everywhere

HyperCode: 
grid.row[i].unique?
grid.col[j].unique?
grid.box[k].unique?

The code LOOKS like the problem it's solving ✨
