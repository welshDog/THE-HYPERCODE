## 🎯 General Questions

### What is HyperCode?

HyperCode is a programming language specifically designed for neurodivergent developers. It combines modern programming paradigms with an intuitive syntax that aligns with diverse cognitive patterns, making coding more accessible for people with ADHD, dyslexia, autism, and other neurodivergent traits.

### Who is HyperCode for?

- 🧠 Neurodivergent developers (ADHD, dyslexia, autism, etc.)
- 🎓 Students learning to code who struggle with traditional languages
- 👨‍💻 Professional developers looking for clearer, more explicit syntax
- 👥 Teams wanting to write more accessible, maintainable code

### Is HyperCode production-ready?

HyperCode is currently in active development (Phase 1). The core language features are being implemented and tested. Check the [Development Roadmap](../README.md#development-roadmap) for current status.

## 🧠 Neurodivergent-Friendly Features

### What makes HyperCode "neurodivergent-friendly"?

1. **Chunked Syntax**: Code is organized in clear, scannable blocks
2. **Visual Flow Indicators**: Symbols like `↓` show program flow direction
3. **Explicit State Markers**: `@loading`, `@error` make state obvious
4. **Friendly Error Messages**: No cryptic compiler errors
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Predictable structure reduces cognitive load
6. **High Contrast Themes**: Built-in syntax themes for visual clarity

### Can I customize the IDE/editor experience?

Yes! HyperCode supports:
- 🎨 Custom syntax themes (including high-contrast options)
- ⌨️ Keyboard-first navigation
- 🔊 Screen reader compatibility
- 📝 Adjustable font sizes and spacing
- 🚦 Visual flow indicators (can be toggled)

### Does HyperCode help with focus/attention?

- **Chunked blocks** break code into digestible pieces
- **Visual markers** provide "anchor points" for scanning
- **Minimal syntax** reduces distractions
- **Inline documentation** keeps context close
- **Quiet errors** avoid overwhelming feedback
