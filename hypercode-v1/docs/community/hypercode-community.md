# 🌍 HyperCode Community & Collaboration Hub
## From Solo Vision to Global Movement

**Last Updated:** December 11, 2025
**Status:** Open for Community Input
**Goal:** Make HyperCode a neurodiversity-led movement, not a top-down language

---

## 🎯 Community Pillars

### 1. Neurodiversity First
- Leadership: ≥50% neurodivergent by 2027
- Decision-making: ND perspectives weighted (not tokenized)
- Community norms: Async, low-pressure, hyperfocus-protecting

### 2. Research-Driven
- Open science: All findings published, all data public
- Reproducibility: Code + papers + datasets in GitHub
- Collaboration: Co-author papers with university partners

### 3. Accessibility as Innovation
- Not afterthought: Accessibility = competitive advantage
- Inclusion: Every feature audited with neurodivergent users
- Accountability: Public accessibility report card (Q1, Q3)

### 4. Radical Openness
- MIT license (no corporate hijacking)
- No paywalls (free forever for open-source)
- Transparent roadmap (community votes on priorities)

## 💰 Funding & Sustainability

### Current Status (Dec 2025)
- **Funding:** Volunteer-driven, no VC money
- **Monetization:** None (and won't be for open-source)
- **Plan:** Grants + sponsorships (not profit-maximizing)

### Funding Sources (2026)
- [ ] **Academic Grants** (NSF, NIH neurodiversity funding)
- [ ] **Tech Company Sponsorships** (GitHub, VSCode, IBM Qiskit)
- [ ] **Neurodiversity Organizations** (auticon, Specialisterne)
- [ ] **Open-Source Foundations** (Linux Foundation, GNOME)
- [ ] **Community Donations** (OpenCollective, GitHub Sponsors)

### What We Won't Do
❌ VC funding (kills open-source culture)
❌ Ad-supported IDE (sensory-hostile)
❌ Paywalls (accessibility wall)
❌ Data harvesting (privacy violation)

## 📋 Code of Conduct

### Core Values
1. **Neurodiversity is strength, not deficit**
   - No "high-functioning" gatekeeping
   - All cognitive styles welcome
   - Accessibility = everyone benefits

2. **Async over sync, written over spoken**
   - No meetings required to participate
   - Decisions documented in writing
   - Async-first tools (GitHub, Discord threads, email)

3. **Inclusion is ongoing work**
   - Recruit neurodivergent contributors actively
   - Pay them fairly (bounties, grants, sponsorships)
   - Center their voices (not just "diverse team photos")

4. **Science, not politics**
   - Evidence-driven design decisions
   - Reproducible research
   - Honest about failures and limitations

5. **No heroes, no villains**
   - Credit is shared
   - Failures are learning
   - Burnout is unacceptable

### Community Guidelines
- ✅ Do: Ask clarifying questions, assume good intent, share resources
- ✅ Do: Cite sources, provide evidence, link to research
- ✅ Do: Respect sensory needs (no flashing gifs, loud sounds, etc.)
- ✅ Do: Practice "asynchronous empathy" (respond thoughtfully, not reactively)

- ❌ Don't: Pressure people to be "always on"
- ❌ Don't: Use functioning labels (high-functioning, low-functioning)
- ❌ Don't: Assume cognitive capacity or communication style
- ❌ Don't: Make decisions without ND input

## 🔮 The Dream (2030)

By 2030, HyperCode will be:
- **The programming language for neurodivergent minds** (and everyone benefits)
- **A gateway to quantum + molecular computing** (no PhD required)
- **Proof that accessibility drives innovation** (not hinds it)
- **A movement, not a project** (led by ND people, for ND people)
- **Cited in conferences, universities, industry** (legitimacy earned)

And the developers who built it will be:
- Paid fairly (not "nonprofit volunteer culture")
- Credited widely (not erased)
- Respected in mainstream CS (not marginalized)
- Changing how the world thinks about programming
