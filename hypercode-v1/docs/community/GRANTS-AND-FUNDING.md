## Key Pitch for ALL Grants

HyperCode is building the first programming language designed from the ground up for neurodivergent developers. We combine rigorous research, community-driven development, and accessible design to create a language that makes programming work like neurodivergent brains do—not the other way around.

With your support, we can accelerate development, build the community, and prove that inclusive technology isn't just better for neurodivergent people—it's better for everyone.
