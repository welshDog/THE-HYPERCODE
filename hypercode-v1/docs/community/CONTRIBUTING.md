## ✨ Coding Standards

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness

Write code that's easy to understand, not impressive.

```python
# ✅ Good
user_count = len(active_users)

# ❌ Bad (too clever)
user_count = sum(1 for u in active_users if u.active)
```

### 2. Add Comments (Especially for ADHD Brains)

Explain the WHY, not the what.

```python
# ✅ Good
# We filter for active users first to avoid processing inactive accounts
active = [u for u in users if u.active]

# ❌ Bad (comment just repeats code)
# Filter for active users
active = [u for u in users if u.active]
```

### 3. Test Your Code

```bash
# Add tests for new features
python -m pytest tests/test_your_feature.py -v
```

### 4. Use Type Hints

```python
# ✅ Good
def process_data(data: list[str]) -> dict[str, int]:
    return {"count": len(data)}

# ❌ Bad (no types)
def process_data(data):
    return {"count": len(data)}
```
