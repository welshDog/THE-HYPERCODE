## 🎯 The Core Mission

**Forgotten genius resurrected. AI made accessible. Neurodivergent minds honored. Programming redefined.**

HyperCode isn't just another language. It's a **fundamental rethinking** of how we express logic and problem-solving for minds that don't think in straight lines.

### Why HyperCode Exists

Traditional programming languages were designed for **linear, sequential thinkers**. What about the rest of us?

- **40+ million neurodivergent developers worldwide** lack tools that match their brain patterns
- **Esoteric languages** (Plankalkül, Befunge, Brainfuck) hold experimental truths that mainstream programming forgot
- **AI integration** requires a language designed for machines, not just humans
- **The future** (quantum, DNA computing, neural interfaces) needs spatial logic, not sequential syntax

HyperCode is the answer.

---

## ✨ What Makes HyperCode Different

### 🧠 Spatial Logic Over Sequential
Think in connections and relationships, not step-by-step procedures.

```hypercode
# Traditional Language (Linear)
result = 0
for i in range(5):
    result = result + i
print(result)

# HyperCode (Spatial)
[0..4] | sum → output
```

**Why it matters**: Neurodivergent brains work spatially. HyperCode matches that.

### 🎨 Minimal Noise, Maximum Clarity
No syntax clutter. No semicolons screaming at you. Just code that breathes.

```hypercode
# What you write:
name | greet → say

# What happens:
Hello, [name]!
```

### 🤖 AI-Native From Day One
Built to work seamlessly with GPT, Claude, Mistral, Ollama, and future models.

```hypercode
# HyperCode + AI agents understand this instantly
process [data] | analyze | recommend → action
```

### 🌈 Neurodivergent-First Design
- **ADHD-friendly**: Examples in 5-minute chunks
- **Dyslexia-accessible**: Clear visual separation, readable fonts
- **Autism spectrum**: Logical consistency, minimal ambiguity
- **All minds**: No shame, no gatekeeping, pure inclusion

### 🔬 Standing on the Shoulders of Giants
Learns from forgotten languages:
- **Plankalkül** (first ever language, 1943) - deep inspiration
- **Befunge** (spatial 2D programming) - spatial logic pioneer
- **INTERCAL** (esoteric brilliance) - creative expression
- **Lisp** (homoiconicity) - code as data philosophy

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Minutes

### **Option 1: Quick Install (Recommended for ADHD brains)**

```bash
# One command to rule them all
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/welshDog/hypercode/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

**✅ Done!** You're ready to code.

### **Option 2: Manual Install**

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/welshDog/hypercode.git
cd hypercode

## 🛠️ Development Workflow (Windows)

We provide a PowerShell script (`make.ps1`) to simplify common development tasks on Windows:

### First Time Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd path\to\hypercode
   ```

2. Set the execution policy (one-time setup, run as Administrator if needed):
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   ```

### Common Tasks

- **Install dependencies**:
  ```powershell
  .\make.ps1 install
  ```

- **Run tests**:
  ```powershell
  .\make.ps1 test
  ```

- **Run tests with coverage**:
  ```powershell
  .\make.ps1 test-cov
  ```

- **Format code**:
  ```powershell
  .\make.ps1 format
  ```

- **Run linters**:
  ```powershell
  .\make.ps1 lint
  ```

- **Run type checking**:
  ```powershell
  .\make.ps1 typecheck
  ```

- **Clean build artifacts**:
  ```powershell
  .\make.ps1 clean
  ```

- **Full setup (install + test + lint + typecheck)**:
  ```powershell
  .\make.ps1 dev-setup
  ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission issues, try running PowerShell as Administrator or use:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\make.ps1 <command>
```

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.lock

# Verify it worked
python -m src.hypercode --version
```

**Expected output:**
```
HyperCode v0.1.0 🧠⚡
Ready to think differently.
```

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip (comes with Python)
- 5 minutes of focus time ⏱️

---

## 💡 Your First HyperCode Program

### Step 1: Create a file
```bash
touch hello.hc
```

### Step 2: Write your first program
```hypercode
# hello.hc - Your first HyperCode program

"Hello, Neurodivergent World!" → output
5 | multiply by 2 → result
[1, 2, 3] | sum → total

print: output
print: result  
print: total
```

### Step 3: Run it
```bash
python -m src.hypercode hello.hc
```

### Step 4: See the magic ✨
```
Hello, Neurodivergent World!
Result: 10
Total: 6
```

**🎉 Congratulations!** You just wrote HyperCode. Your brain already gets it.

## 📚 Core Concepts (No Theory Walls)

### Pipes: The Flow of Logic
Everything flows left-to-right like your thoughts.

```hypercode
# Read this like: "take input, validate, transform, output"
input | validate | transform | output
```

### Spatial Grouping: Think in Blocks
Group related concepts together spatially.

```hypercode
[
  user_name | clean,
  user_age | validate,
  user_email | format
] → save_user
```

### Pattern Matching: Describe What You Want
Tell HyperCode what you're looking for, not how to find it.

```hypercode
data | find { type = "admin" } → admins
```

### AI-Ready Syntax
Write in a way that AI understands instantly.

```hypercode
# Claude/GPT can generate and explain this without confusion
process [files] | filter | compress | upload → result
```

## 🎓 Examples & Tutorials

### DuelCode Counter Tutorial

We've created a comprehensive tutorial that demonstrates HyperCode's dual representation approach with a simple counter application. This tutorial has been validated against our DuelCode standards and showcases:

- 🎯 **Dual Representation**: See the same concept expressed in both visual and code formats
- 🧩 **Interactive Elements**: Learn how to create responsive UI components
- 🏗️ **Progressive Learning**: Start simple and gradually add more complex features
- ✅ **Validation**: Fully compliant with DuelCode documentation standards

Check out the tutorial in the `examples/duelcode/` directory to see how HyperCode makes programming more accessible to neurodivergent thinkers.

### Example 1: Data Processing
```hypercode
# Read CSV, filter, calculate stats
load "data.csv" → raw
raw | filter { score > 80 } → passing
passing | average "score" → mean
mean → print
```

### Example 2: API Integration
```hypercode
fetch "https://api.example.com/users" → users
users | filter { active = true } → active_users
active_users | count → total
total → print
```

### Example 3: Game Logic (Spatial!)
```hypercode
# Spatial nature of HyperCode makes games natural
[
  player_x, player_y,
  enemy_x, enemy_y
] | distance → collision_check

collision_check > 0 ? "Hit!" : "Safe"
```

## 🙏 Special Thanks

**To the forgotten languages** that came before us (Plankalkül, Befunge, INTERCAL, Lisp) — you showed us what was possible.

**To neurodivergent developers everywhere** — your brilliance deserves better tools. We're building them.

**To our community** — you're not just using HyperCode, you're *shaping* it.

## ⚡ One Last Thing

> **"Programming languages are more than syntax. They are an expression of how minds think."**

For too long, programming languages were built by neurotypical brains, for neurotypical brains. They work, sure. But they never *feel right* for minds that think spatially.

HyperCode changes that.

**This is your language. This is your movement. This is your future.**

Welcome to HyperCode. ✨
