# HyperCode Community Code of Conduct 💙

**We're neurodivergent. We're different. We're here to stay.**

---

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a **welcoming, inclusive, and supportive** community for ALL neurodivergent developers, allies, and everyone in between.

HyperCode is built BY neurodivergent brains FOR neurodivergent brains. That means:

✅ **We celebrate different thinking styles**  
✅ **We honor all neurodivergences** (ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia, etc.)  
✅ **We reject ableism** in all forms  
✅ **We embrace slow productivity** (hyperfocus and burnout are both valid)  
✅ **We don't shame anyone** for how their brain works  

---

## Expected Behavior

### In Code & Comments
- ✅ Be kind in code reviews
- ✅ Explain criticism constructively
- ✅ Celebrate learning moments
- ✅ Share knowledge generously
- ✅ Assume good intent

### In Discussions & Issues
- ✅ Listen to understand, not to respond
- ✅ Make space for quiet voices
- ✅ Use plain language when possible
- ✅ Provide context when needed
- ✅ No gatekeeping—everyone belongs

### In Our Community
- ✅ Welcome new contributors enthusiastically
- ✅ Be patient (some days are harder than others)
- ✅ Celebrate all contributions, big & small
- ✅ Support each other's boundaries
- ✅ Default to kindness

---

## What We Don't Tolerate

❌ **Ableism**: Language like "broken brain," "high-functioning," "you don't look autistic"  
❌ **Gatekeeping**: "Real programmers know X," "you're not qualified"  
❌ **Shame**: Making anyone feel bad for:
- Coding style
- Speed of work
- Mental health needs
- Taking breaks
- Asking for help

❌ **Discrimination**: Based on race, gender, sexuality, disability, neurodivergence, or any identity  
❌ **Harassment**: Threats, targeting, or bullying of any kind  
❌ **Exclusion**: Deliberately leaving people out

## Specific Neurodivergent Considerations

### For ADHD Community Members
✅ Hyperfocus bursts are valid work patterns  
✅ Task-switching isn't laziness  
✅ Interruptions are hard—respect focus time  
✅ Documentation is appreciated but don't demand perfection  

### For Autistic Community Members
✅ Direct communication is appreciated  
✅ Logic-first explanations help  
✅ Consistency matters  
✅ Small talk isn't required  

### For Dyslexic Community Members
✅ Font choices matter (dyslexia-friendly fonts available)  
✅ Spelling errors don't mean stupidity  
✅ Visual vs. text-heavy documentation both work  
✅ Grammar-shaming isn't acceptable  

### For Everyone
✅ Burnout is real—pace matters  
✅ Some days are harder than others  
✅ Stimming/fidgeting is okay  
✅ Boundaries are respected  
✅ Masking isn't required

## If Something Goes Wrong

### You Experienced Harm
1. **You're safe here.** We believe you.
2. **Document it** (screenshot/note what happened)
3. **Report it** to conduct@hypercode.dev
4. **We'll respond** within 48 hours
5. **We'll take action** (always)

### We'll Handle:
- Private, confidential conversations

## Consequences

**We take violations seriously.**

### First Violation

- Temporary muting/ban from discussions
- Public acknowledgment if appropriate

### Severe Violations
- Immediate removal from community
- No path to return
- Examples: threats, harassment, hate speech

---

## Marginalizations & Power

**We acknowledge power dynamics.**

If you hold privilege (neurotypicality, race, gender, etc.) in our community, use it responsibly:

✅ Amplify voices that get silenced  
✅ Step back when needed  
✅ Ask "Is this mine to say?"  
✅ Listen to feedback  
✅ Don't center your experience  

---

## Mental Health & Burnout

**We recognize that our community includes people experiencing mental health challenges.**

### We Support
✅ Taking breaks when needed  
✅ Saying "I need to step back"  
✅ Reducing contribution when overwhelmed  
✅ Seeking professional help  
✅ Being honest about capacity  

### We Don't Support
❌ Pushing through burnout  
❌ Shame for stepping back  
❌ Pressure to "prove" you're struggling  
❌ "Just think positive" advice  
❌ Ableist productivity culture

## Accessibility

**We're committed to accessibility.**

### Current Commitments
✅ ADHD-friendly docs (short sections, examples)  
✅ Dyslexia-friendly fonts in code samples  
✅ High contrast mode options  
✅ Alt text on all images  
✅ Captions on videos (coming)
