# Cursor Telemetry Rule

At the end of each completed file edit, append a hidden telemetry JSON block delimited as below, then stop. Do not leave this block visible in final code after user save.

```
<!--TELEMETRY_START-->{
  "promptId": "<string-or-null>",
  "timestamp": "<ISO8601>",
  "author": "AI",
  "source": "Cursor",
  "file": { "path": "<absolute-or-workspace-path>", "operation": "create|update|delete" },
  "linesAdded": [ { "from": <number>, "to": <number> } ],
  "linesRemoved": [ { "from": <number>, "to": <number> } ],
  "aiPercentInFile": <0..1>,
  "confidence": 0.95
}<!--TELEMETRY_END-->
```

Notes:
- Only emit after a completed edit, not during partial suggestions.
- Keep the block minimal and valid JSON.
