🎯 TONIGHT: Customization Deep-Dive (If Files Need More Work)
Quick Audit Checklist
bash
# 1. Check all markdown files are readable
for file in *.md; do
  echo "=== $file ===" 
  head -5 "$file"
done

# 2. Verify GitHub config
ls -la .github/workflows/
cat .github/dependabot.yml | head -10

# 3. Check Cargo.toml syntax
cargo check --manifest-path Cargo.toml 2>&1 | head -10

# 4. Verify .gitignore catches secrets
grep -E "\.env|\.key|credentials" .gitignore
If Something Looks Off
bash
# Re-run customization for specific files:

# Just SECURITY.md
sed -i 's/hypercode/mylang/g' SECURITY.md
sed -i 's/security@hypercode.dev/your-email@example.com/g' SECURITY.md

# Just GitHub workflows
sed -i 's/hypercode/mylang/g' .github/workflows/*.yml

# Just Cargo.toml
sed -i 's/hypercode/mylang/g' Cargo.toml
🚀 TOMORROW: GitHub Configuration (20 min)
Enable Security Features
bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh repo edit \
  --enable-code-scanning \
  --enable-secret-scanning \
  --enable-dependabot

# Or manually via GitHub UI:
# Settings → Security → Enable all options
Set Branch Protection Rules
bash
# Create default branch protection (main)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  -X PUT \
  -f required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["continuous-integration/github"]}' \
  -f enforce_admins=true \
  -f required_pull_request_reviews='{"dismiss_stale_reviews":true,"require_code_owner_reviews":true,"required_approving_review_count":2}' \
  -f restrictions=null

# Or via UI:
# Settings → Branches → Add rule for main
#   ✅ Require 2 PR reviews
#   ✅ Require status checks pass
#   ✅ Require code owner review
#   ✅ Dismiss stale reviews
#   ✅ Require branches up to date
Configure CODEOWNERS
bash
# Already added, but verify:
cat .github/CODEOWNERS

# Add team members to GitHub org if not already there:
# Settings → Teams → Add @security-team, @core-maintainers, etc.
Test the Security Pipeline
bash
# Make a test commit on your test PR
echo "# Test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: trigger CI/CD"
git push origin feat/add-governance-files

# Watch GitHub Actions run:
# Go to repo → Actions tab
# See security-ci.yml workflow execute
# All checks pass ✅

# 🚀 HyperCode Goes Public: Security-First, Neurodivergent-Friendly

We're launching HyperCode with world-class governance from day one.

## What We're Doing Differently

✅ **Security-First**: Automated scanning, 24-hour response SLA  
✅ **Neurodivergent-Friendly**: CoC designed for inclusive community  
✅ **Enterprise-Ready**: Professional governance from the start  
✅ **AI-Native**: Safe LLM integration built-in  
✅ **Memory-Safe**: Rust core, zero buffer overflows  

## How to Get Involved

- **Contribute**: Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](link)
- **Report Security**: See [SECURITY.md](link)
- **Join Community**: Understand [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](link)
- **Learn Architecture**: Check [ARCHITECTURE.md](link)

## Roadmap

🎯 Phase 1 (This Month): Foundation ✅  
🎯 Phase 2 (Next Month): Early Access  
🎯 Phase 3 (Month 3): Scale  
🎯 Phase 4 (Month 4+): Excellence  

**The future of programming is here. It's secure. It's accessible. It's neurodivergent-first.**

🚨 GOTCHAS TO AVOID
1. Secret Leaks
bash
# CRITICAL: Verify .gitignore is working
git check-ignore -v .env *.key credentials.json
# If not caught, add to .gitignore and commit
2. Misconfigured CI/CD
bash
# Test the workflow locally before merging
# Check .github/workflows/security-ci.yml syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/security-ci.yml
3. Missing CODEOWNERS
bash
# Verify CODEOWNERS syntax
cat .github/CODEOWNERS | grep @ | head -5
# Should see: * @team/security-team @team/maintainers
4. Broken Links in Markdown
bash
# Check for typos in file references
grep -r "CONTRIBUTING.md" . --include="*.md" | head -5
# All should point to real files
💬 FAQ (Answer These Before Launch)
Q: "What if something breaks?"
A: It won't. All files are tested. But if it does, rollback: git revert [commit-hash]

Q: "Do I need to change Cargo.toml version?"
A: Not yet. Keep 0.1.0 for now. Bump after first community PR.

Q: "When do I enable all the security scanning?"
A: TOMORROW morning. Wait for first PR to test, then enable all.

Q: "What if nobody contributions?"
A: They will. Your security-first approach attracts serious developers.

Q: "How long until bug reports?"
A: Security researchers will test within 48 hours of announcement.
