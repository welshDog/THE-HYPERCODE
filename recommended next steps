1. Verify the New API and Run Tests

First, it is critical to validate the hypercode.execute() API I just added. As I was unable to run tests, you should do so to ensure nothing was broken.

Action: From the THE-HYPERCODE directory, run pytest in your terminal to execute the project's test suite.
2. Formalize the Language Grammar (Roadmap 2.1)
The project uses a hand-written parser, but the roadmap rightly calls for a formal ANTLR grammar. This is foundational for building a stable language and attracting contributors.

Action: Update the syntax/HyperCode.g4 file to precisely match the language syntax that the current parser accepts.
Action: Decide whether to replace the hand-written parser with one generated from the ANTLR grammar (the roadmap's original plan) or to keep the hand-written one and use the grammar as a formal specification for testing.
3. Create a Pluggable Backend System (Roadmap 2.3, 2.6, 2.7)
To achieve the vision of being "multi-backend capable," the connection between the interpreter and its backends needs to be formalized.

Action: Create a BaseBackend abstract class that defines the interface a backend must provide (e.g., an execute(ir) method).
Action: Refactor the qiskit_backend.py to implement this new interface.
Action: Modify the Evaluator to load and call backends through this common interface. This will make adding the Classical and Molecular backends much cleaner.
4. Improve Testing and Error Handling (Roadmap 3.2 & 3.3)
A production-ready language needs excellent tests and user-friendly error messages.

Action: Increase test coverage for the parser, evaluator, and the new API.
Action: Enhance the parser and evaluator to produce detailed error messages with line and column numbers, as planned in the roadmap.
5. Update the Project Roadmap
Your ROADMAP.md contains a great vision, but it's out of sync with the actual progress. Updating it is crucial for project clarity.

Action: Mark the completed portions of the CLI, parser, and Qiskit backend as "In Progress" or "Partially Complete" in the roadmap file. This gives a clear and accurate picture of the project's current status.
